Oddly enough after 24 years, and getting the okay from [Eiichiro] Oda, they brought me back on as a director for this particular film. I've been watching the series more as an outsider so if you have questions about 1,000 episodes, I'm going to pass that to Shibata-san next to me [laughs].&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<strong>Hiroaki Shibata</strong>: I'm Hiroaki Shibata. Like Shimizu-san, I was also a producer on <em><strong>Film Red</strong></em>. When I first got involved on <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em>,&nbsp;when the anime&nbsp;first started, I was very much a newbie. I was like assistant to the assistant to the line producer. So my main tasks included chasing down schedules, making sure we got all the keyframes so we can move it along the pipeline so to speak. I was also involved in the original opening \"We Are!\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"One Piece Film Red\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/79bb1a99a4536299de5186b87e06bbcd1667358519_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>Why do you think <em>Film Red</em> is the most successful <em>One Piece</em> film?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shimizu</strong>: [laughs] Well, the honest answer is I don't really know.&nbsp;Of course, Eiichiro Oda&nbsp;has been working on the manga for 25 years now. So when we assembled our team we didn't want to half-bake it, that's what I was thinking about at the time. But how that translated into a box office hit, I'm not really sure but I'm here in New York right now and talking to people so it's great. I'm happy!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taniguchi</strong>: To add to what Shimizu-san said,&nbsp;one of the requests I had at the inception of this project was that we really wanted to leave a mark and hit our own milestones and kind of challenge the status quo, as it were. So the team and I had a really long thinking session and I think the ideas that we were able to bring to the table collectively is what resulted in this and really resonated with the fans. I think that is probably what translated into the box-office success that we saw.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shibata</strong>: [<em><strong>Film Red</strong></em>] was a&nbsp;rare opportunity for me to get to see Oda-sensei working really up close. I think he is personally very excited right now as <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> is entering its final arc. I think that is, in a good way, kind of contagious. So between Oda-sensei and [Taniguchi-san], that really translated into the staff and everyone put a lot of energy and hard work into the project. I think that really spoke to the Japanese fans and here we are.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>How do you think the <em>One Piece</em> movies changed after Oda-sensei became more involved?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shimizu</strong>: [For <em><strong>Film Red</strong></em>], one of the biggest changes or shifts with this movie, in particular, is that Oda-sensei was very insistent on having a strong female lead and role. In&nbsp;the past&nbsp;<em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> films, the villain or the enemy is generally this hulky&nbsp;macho man. It's a very clear villain figure but he wanted to do something different this time. That was what kicked off the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>What was it like working with Shuichi Ikeda, the voice of Shanks?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shimizu</strong>: Since [Shanks] first appeared in the series, it's been about 20 years and he didn't have much to do. [Ikeda] is&nbsp;a really amazing actor and a very hard worker. So in <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em>, Shanks is a very unique character. Again, like I mentioned that 20-year blank, I think it was really hard for him to get back into character and dial that in. But he was very grateful and was up to the challenge. The result&nbsp;I think was something that we were all happy with.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"One Piece Film Red\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/affbbc28795317001c7db0a57eed88621667358547_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>For Taniguchi-san: What do you think you have learned most from your first time directing a <em>One Piece</em> anime to <em>Film Red</em>?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taniguchi</strong>: I think the biggest shift, and this ties into my own career, is since the first <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> film I've directed until now, I've gained a lot of experience as a producer. I've had the opportunity to produce a few projects. That's something I didn't have initially. So that experience enabled me to really understand what was being asked and what was the expectation for this film. That translated into how I can kind of derive my own answer of how to make that happen and how to bring that to the screen. So that change in&nbsp;vantage point or perspective, I think is the biggest shift between 25 years and now.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>I also understand that Taniguchi-san is actually an old friend of Oda-sensei. But how did you meet him? And what has it been like being his friend over the years?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taniguchi</strong>: The very first time I met Oda-sensei was when we were going to animate [<em><strong>One Piece: Defeat The Pirate Ganzack</strong></em>]. After the initial encounter, most of my interfacing with Oda-sensei was through the first-generation editor for the <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> manga at Shueisha, a gentleman named [Takanori] Asara. Through him, Oda-sensei and I would kind of exchange ideas talk about what we were working on. So I would say it wasn't really too much direct communication, but we were in communication at that time. We would say what are you up to, what kind of ideas do you have about this. Really, it's more of an idea exchange type of relationship.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Asara actually was getting married, so I thought, \"Oh, I'm gonna have the opportunity to see Oda-sensei again.\" Incidentally, that was right when a manuscript was due. Oda-sensei asked Asara what's more important, him&nbsp;attending his&nbsp;wedding or completing the manuscript, to which Asara responded, despite it being his own wedding, he&nbsp;should work on the manga. So it really goes to show how much of a workaholic he is. [laughs]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"One Piece Film Red\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/ea02161ed53dbe7351af18f3733809cc1667358572_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>For Shibata, Where do you think the future of <em>One</em> <em>Piece</em> movies heads from here?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shibata</strong>: Honestly, with <em><strong>Film Red</strong></em> just being finished, I personally am not really sure where the future's headed at this moment. I think speaking on behalf of most of the people on the team, it's still unknown but what Oda-sensei did say is that after 25 years, the stage is set for real <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> to begin.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, what I can say is no one really knows where the project is going to head but I do know that Oda-sensei has a grand vision of where it's going to go. As a producer of the&nbsp;TV series, I personally am really excited and look forward to how we translate his manga into anime, and by extension, the film projects as well. I do believe we're going to continue to challenge the status quo and evolve the movies as time goes on. But what that means specifically, honestly, right now, I don't know. With the TV series now, of course, on Crunchyroll&nbsp;simulcasting 1000 episodes, I think it's time for the whole world to share in that journey.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>How do you think <em>One Piece</em> fans have changed over the years? Is there something you think fans resonate with now that they maybe did not in the past?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shimizu</strong>: <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> being such a long-running series of course over the years we've gained a lot of fans, but I think it's quite clear to us as well that the demographics and age group have gradually gone up and up.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But with this film&nbsp;too, of course, I think movies, the streaming and the general accessibility of the manga&nbsp;in this new age, the demographics have certainly expanded. This shocked me as well, but even some teens that I've heard from they've seen all the episodes, which to me is a daunting challenge to think about how far the series has come. So&nbsp;how do you begin or where do you tackle that from? So I was shocked when I heard that.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Of course, [<em><strong>Film Red</strong></em>]&nbsp;was a box office hit in Japan. But what is more interesting&nbsp;I think is how the demographic is expanding. There&nbsp;were fans of the franchise that I would just look at them and think, \"Oh, there's no way these kids would have read or watched or even tried to engage with something just massive and monumental.\" But I think it's that discovery and the accessibility that I hinted at earlier. I think more so than the film being such a huge success, that's what would really make Oda-sensei&nbsp;happy, not just old farts like myself, but the ability for the younger generation to discover and interact and experience <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"One Piece Film Red\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/6a524b58c571baa5a2da9edd9372a2231667358667_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>Now that <em>One Piece</em> is heading into its endgame, is there one word that you think describes what the Straw Hats are heading into?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shimizu</strong>: \"Adventure!\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taniguchi</strong>: Romance Dawn.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Translator</strong>: But that’s two words.&nbsp;[laughs]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shimizu, Taniguchi, Shibata</strong>: [laughs]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taniguchi</strong>: Then, \"Dawn!\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shibata</strong>: I would say “<em><strong>One Piece</strong></em>,” but that’s also two words. [laughs]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>For my final question then, is there anything that you would like to say to international fans of <em>One Piece</em>?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shimizu</strong>: [<em><strong>One Piece</strong></em>] is going to&nbsp;get way more interesting. It's going to a really, really amazing place.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taniguchi</strong>: With <em><strong>Film Red</strong></em>,&nbsp;even if you don't really know the <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> story or maybe you've watched or&nbsp;read it before a long time ago&nbsp;but you haven't really interfaced with it recently, this movie is accessible for everyone. I&nbsp;think there is something for each person watching this film. Even the action sequences, some of the more emotional moments and the humor. It's a really, really fun film all around. I hope everyone gets the chance to see this and enjoy it.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shibata</strong>: The dubs are catching up with the subtitles, I believe with the Whole Cake arc. With that in mind, it’s a great time to be a <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> fan. I can’t wait to watch the WANO KUNI arc dubbed myself.

In just a minute and a half&nbsp;it tells you precisely what <em><strong>SPY x FAMILY</strong></em> is about and why it’s such an enjoyable show.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/09/24-1/feature-what-you-need-to-know-before-spy-x-family-returns\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">What You Need to Know Before SPY x FAMILY Returns</span></a></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Whereas the first opening leaned into more stylized artwork and spy comic aesthetics, the new opening emphasizes the Forgers’ day-to-day life as a family. Bright, lavishly animated scenes of the Forgers driving through the city on an outing (or is it <em>ooting</em>?), having breakfast together, going on amusement park rides, and generally being a family take the spotlight. Contrasting with these are clips of the Forgers separate from each other that carry a darker palette and a sense of melancholy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Loid in the second SPY x FAMILY opening\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/de36c7fb27a6d39f7b5ad570dc4fb0731666196893_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Right off the bat, this opening highlights how much living together as a family enriches Loid, Yor, and Anya. While we don’t know much about Yor and Anya’s past, we can infer that neither of them had close connections with others (with the exception of Yor’s brother). When Yor and Anya meet up with Loid on a walk&nbsp;their joy and affection are clear. Without a word being spoken, Anya’s body language and actions tell you that, telepath or not, in this she’s just a little girl excited to see her father. On Loid’s end, the grim tension he carries in all his solo scenes completely vanishes when he’s with Yor and Anya. As they drive through the city, he’s obviously at ease, something that we know from the first half of the show is unusual for him.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It’s striking how engrossing moments like these are given how mundane the content is. Going on a drive through the city has an upbeat energy to it similar to a kid going on an adventure. This is doubly interesting since this opening was directed by Tetsuro Araki, who’s best known for directing the likes of <a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/death-note/episode-1-rebirth-791577?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=death-note_en&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_death-note_en\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em><strong>Death Note</strong></em></span></a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchyroll.com/attack-on-titan?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=aot_en&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_aot_en\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em><strong>Attack on Titan</strong></em></span></a>. With these two series, his style tended toward intense action, dramatic twists, and emotions dialed up to 11. While <em><strong>SPY x FAMILY</strong></em> might feel like a sharp contrast, you can see his flourishes in the dynamic camera following Anya and Yor on the carnival ride and Anya’s exuberant energy that comes through every time she moves. Araki imbues this opening with an infectious level of energy that just invites you to come along for the ride.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Loid and Yor with Bond in SPY x FAMILY second opening\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/743b13ce7aa69f97beb9ac919942cd0d1666197283_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There’s also no way to talk about this opening without getting into the song, \"Souvenir,\" by Bump of Chicken. Bump of Chicken has done a fair amount of anime work&nbsp;over the years&nbsp;like <a href=\"http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/04/17/bump-of-chickens-25th-detective-conan-film-theme-song-mv-depicts-a-world-where-time-has-stopped?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_news\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">the theme song</span></a> for the 25th <strong><em>Detective Conan</em></strong> movie,&nbsp;<strong><em>Detective Conan: The Bride of Halloween</em></strong>,&nbsp;and the <strong><em>Pokemon</em></strong> anniversary<strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"> </span></strong><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/10/07-1/pokmon-gotcha-anime-music-video-catches-over-10-million-views?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_news\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">music video</span></a>.

That might not seem related, but the exact same appeal that got fans so abuzz about the commercials is present here. Bump of Chicken’s upbeat tempo and soft vocals evoke a sense of wonder that combines with depictions of ordinary life to bring a feeling of longing for it, mirroring the Forgers’ growing fondness for the life they have together — even with all their secrets.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/10/03/feature-much-like-spy-x-family-these-anime-series-understand-the-significance-of-found-family\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Much Like SPY x FAMILY These Anime Series Understand the Significance of Found Family</span></a></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That’s really what <em><strong>SPY x FAMILY</strong></em> is all about. Loid’s spy antics are fun but the real draw is how those intersect with the family he’s had to put together. Loid, Yor, and Anya make an adorable family and the spy missions are a great way to highlight that. Just look at Loid trying to find a secret message in a penguin while simultaneously taking his wife and daughter on a trip to an aquarium, or Yor swooping in to save Anya (and her new canine friend) from a group of terrorists. Everyone is at their best when they get to bounce off each other, which is exactly what this opening highlights.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Anya, Yor, and Bond in SPY x FAMILY second opening\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/94f8529cf0c073ce939670c2db3a41d11666198986_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The best openings are the ones that combine great music and visuals to tell you something about the show.

I already knew how the story in the original manga had developed, which made me feel a bit like I was under a bit of pressure to play these scenes myself. That being said, I think I was most excited and happy to be a part of the production again.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>So you’ve been voicing Mob for over six years now, has anything changed in the way you approach his character?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito:</b> Well, not so much in playing Mob-kun, but rather in my own personal growth through stage productions and other works. I have felt a strong change in my own artistic expression. So rather than in playing Mob-kun, I myself have undergone some changes over the past six years. There were some minor changes that made me think, \"In order to be more like Mob-kun, maybe I should express myself in this way now.\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>Right.</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito:</b> I don't think there were any significant differences in my thinking or feelings. Especially from the second to the third term, I don't think I changed that much.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>How do you feel Mob has grown in the previous seasons and specials?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Little by little, there were many moments that made me think that Mob was gaining confidence in themselves. There were some scenes in the second season that showed this, but in the third season, there will be more and more scenes that really showcase him expressing his own determination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the first season, he tended to let others influence him, but as we got into the second season, I could see the growth when Mob-kun started to do more things on his own. I feel like the biggest factor in his growth came about by surrounding himself with more people and making more friends.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>How do you feel the relationships between Mob and other characters have grown over the years?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Well, hmm, when it comes to their friendships, I feel that they are now very much on an even footing. Mob-kun is not an aggressive individual, he often gets told what to do by others, but now I think there are many scenes where he is able to talk with others as an equal. Also, I strongly feel that he has become very trustworthy to those around him. There are quite a few scenes in the third season where you can see this happen more often.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Mob Psycho 100\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/d4247902d3952c78bcfae023ed6961d51666051403_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>What is something you've learned from your colleagues during your time on Mob Psycho 100?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Hmm, [laughs], well basically everything. For me personally, Mob Psycho was the first TV anime and 30-minute TV series in which I was deeply involved as a regular and the first time I played a leading role.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>During the first season, I didn't know my right from my left, but because of Mob Psycho, I am now able to work on other projects thanks to the many things I learned from this work. It is no exaggeration to say that I learned all my foundations from here and I learned so many things from so many people. Even if I did not learn directly from them, I absorbed a lot from watching them perform. I think that I learned a lot from my seniors, including how to perform and how to act on the spot, as well as their attitudes as actors involved in the creation of something.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>Has there been anything that has changed in the recording process from the first season to this one?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Eh? Well, I think the thing that has changed the most is my confidence [laughs]. The third season is the third time I’ve played this role, but compared to the first season, it was totally different. During the first season, I was so nervous that I couldn't sleep the night before. So in that sense, the biggest change was my own feelings, my confidence and my anxiety going into the studio. I feel that I am less anxious and more confident now than I was during the first season.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>Did COVID-19 have any effect on the recording process?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Up until now, it was common for almost the entire cast to get together to record, but now we often record separately with a small group of people. But for Mob Psycho, I was able to work directly with the actual voice actors of the characters I was interacting with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Still, I think the fact that I was not able to see firsthand any of the other scenes being recording like I was able to in the first season and learn from others had a big impact on me. Because of this, there were parts of the story that I didn't understand myself until I saw the finished product and that be able to finally see how the other members of the cast performed their lines. That was the part that changed the most due to COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Setsuo Ito\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/5fd96e0c2102ff7a1c9bf91124a0f4761666051563_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 434px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>Has Mob affected you at all in your life? Are there moments in your daily life you go “Oh, that was a very Mob thing to say or do?”</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: [Laughs heavily]&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Well yes, through the recording of Mob Psycho, I have gained confidence and changed as an actor, but in terms of my daily life, I don't think I have really changed that much. The areas in which I felt I was similar to Mob-kun were mostly from a psychological point of view, so there was nothing that was directly related to my daily life. However, there are people in a variety of places who are familiar with the work Mob Psycho. For example, when I meet a friend of a friend for the first time, I mentioned the name Mob Psycho and an increasing number of people told me they had seen it, which is one of the things that makes me happy.&nbsp; However, I am not sure if there are things I say or do that are so typical of Mob that I myself would consider them to be \"Mob-like\" behaviors.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>With the first two&nbsp;episodes already premiered internationally, how is the rest of the recording going for the series? How much is left?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Well, we’ve got…</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Takamura:</b> It’s okay, Minami-san (BONES studio President) already mentioned this at Crunchyroll Expo.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito:</b> Oh? I see [laughs]. Well, we have already finished recording all the lines. It’s all done!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>Oh! So without spoiling too much, is there a moment from season 3 you’re looking forward to fans seeing?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Hmm, let me think. The trailer has already been released and there's this part at the end where Dimple says a few lines that are part of a bigger scene that I think is super important. This scene has a pretty big event happen for Mob-kun and something very significant comes to ahead in Mob-kun and Dimple's relationship. I believe that this is one of the scenes where all of us the voice actors and animation studio BONES put in all our strength, so I hope you will enjoy watching this scene.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>Ah! So what about from past seasons? What has been your favorite moment?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Favorite scene? Hmm, [laughs]. There are so many, but in the first season, the scene near the last episode when his mentor said to Mob-kun, who was conflicted about whether or not to use his psychic powers on other people, \"It's okay to run away.\" This is my favorite scene and left quite an impression on me. I also really like the first episode of the first season. The episode in which Keiji Fujiwara, the late president of my talent office, appeared as a guest was a very special episode for me, partly because the recording session itself left a strong impression. It was also the first time I saw Sakurai-san (who voices Reigen) perform live, so in that sense, the recording was a memorable experience for me.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second season has a lot of great scenes with master [laughs] but I really like the exchange in the first episode with a girl in the same class who writes novels. I also like the scene where Master Reigen holds a press conference and afterward he and Mob-kun talk where Mob-kun says that Master Reigen is a good guy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I think that’s it [laughs], I've listed about four scenes so I think that is enough.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Mob Psycho 100\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/1975fc93f465c2b5470c3f119a53d2931666051428_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>You’re a star of stage and screen, which do you prefer?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: [Laughs] It is difficult to say which is better. I love both and would like to do both. Especially if it is a performance related to Mob Psycho, then I would want to do it. But the field I originally set my sights on was the anime industry, so in that sense, if I had to choose one over the other, I guess I would have to say that I prefer working in anime.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>What are the differences between playing Mob on the stage versus voicing him in anime?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Well, I think one of the biggest differences compared to anime and with the pandemic is that on stage, there are people in the audience in front of you, so you are performing directly to them. Since the audience is right in right there, I feel there are differences in the way I present the performance and the manner in which the audience perceives and hears it. In contrast to anime, where the actor's voice and the animator's movements are combined to create a complete performance, on stage, I am in charge of everything, which is the most challenging part, but I also feel that this is what makes the stage so special. In particular, Mob-kun was a character who was not very humorous, so in that sense, the most difficult part was not to break down into laughter on stage (laughs).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>Huh. So how has playing Mob on stage changed how you voice Mob in the anime? Or vice versa.</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Well the first time I played Mob-kun after doing the theater performance was during the second season of the anime and I was told at the time that I was \"too energetic.” On stage, my voice would get louder to reach everyone in the audience and the volume would physically increase, but by pulling it off and then recording the anime, I became an emotional, energetic Mob-kun. Maintaining a flat tone was a problem at the beginning of the second season, so I feel like that is what changed the most. However, since I had already experienced this issue during the second season, I don't feel that I had too much trouble in the third season, though from an outsider's perspective, I realized that there were some small variations.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>You’ve done illustrations in the past, including on an episode of Mob Psycho 100, have you been doing any lately? If so, of what?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Ito</b>: Hmm, in relation to Mob Psycho, I drew an illustration to celebrate Mob-kun's birthday, and I uploaded it on my personal Twitter account on his birthday. I have been thinking that I would also like to draw something for the third season of Mob Psycho.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<center>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"display: flex; max-width: 550px; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><iframe id=\"twitter-widget-2\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; width: 550px; height: 826px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=true&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-2&amp;features=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%3D%3D&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1524405038734401536&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crunchyroll.com%2Fanime-feature%2F2022%2F10%2F20-1%2Finterview-mob-psycho-100-va-setsuo-itos-most-anticipated-season-3-mob-scene&amp;sessionId=5594f842aec77d5a199957dd89baa44bd210f7be&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=a3525f077c700%3A1667415560940&amp;width=550px\" data-tweet-id=\"1524405038734401536\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</center>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I have also been drawing pictures privately and showing them in my fan clubs for a while now.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><b>So about season three?</b></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Takamura:</b> That’s a little bit of a secret.

Denji’s currently in the middle of winning the “worst life for an anime protagonist ever” award as he’s stuck dealing with the debt that his deceased father left behind. Denji’s lived in poverty with his only companion, Pochita. Pochita is a Chainsaw Devi that serves as a huggable friend for Denji to curl up with and a way for him to kill devils in an attempt to make money. Denji can never seem to get ahead, though, and soon he’s betrayed by the very people he’s been trying to pay back in his father’s name.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/09/19-1/chainsaw-man-english-dub-reveals-main-cast-dubbed-trailer\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Chainsaw Man English Dub Reveals Main Cast, Dubbed Trailer</span></a></strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As Denji dies, he makes a pact with Pochita, leading to Denji’s body parts being swapped out for chainsaws. That new <em>buzzcut</em> isn’t permanent, though. Denji’s still a man, he’s just now able to become, you know, the title of the story, and he’s leaving a trail of bread crumbs and carnage in his wake.

Pochita and Denji essentially have a “boy and his dog” relationship. That alone is an interesting dynamic, but <em><strong>Chainsaw Man</strong></em> takes it in a unique direction after Denji’s death and rebirth. This new combination of <em>human</em> and <em>devil</em> has never been seen before. For some, it’s an abomination, but for others? It’s an opportunity. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/09/22-1/event-chainsaw-mans-world-premiere-was-a-bloody-good-time\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Chainsaw Man’s World Premiere Was a Bloody Good Time</span></a></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Enter the Devil Hunters, something that Denji <em>technically</em> was, just not under any official status. There’s actually a government-backed organization of devil hunters. This means fighting these deadly foes is kinda seen as a potential occupation you can pursue. The most notable group of hunters is led by a woman named Makima who takes an immediate interest in Denji’s newfound partial devil status.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As to be expected, there’s a bit of moral dynamics at play when you have a set of people who hunt devils, yet some also recognize the strength of such creatures, so they form contracts with them in order to kill their kind. This is especially felt with characters like Denji, who is still relatively human, and <em>fiends</em> like Power — exclamation point required when speaking of her. Fiends are devils who have taken over a human corpse. Like Denji, they are something else that certain Devil Hunters have found a use for. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:26px;\"><strong>Who in the World Revved up This Idea?</strong></span> &nbsp;</h1>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Makima in Chainsaw Man\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/0463959c9de4d9ae6a09d20c5e8b8c8e1664483618_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\">&nbsp;</h1>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Chainsaw Man</strong></em> was created by Tatsuki Fujimoto and began serialization in Shonen Jump back in 2018.

As the lights dimmed and the screen came to life, the first episode of <b><i>Chainsaw Man</i></b> began. The <b><i>Chainsaw Man</i></b> anime is real, and it delivered in bringing Fujimoto’s manga to life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b><i>Chainsaw Man</i></b>’s first episode faithfully adapted the extended first chapter of the manga, bringing that little extra spice only an anime can. I can definitely see how the team at MAPPA are building up to the balls-to-the-wall craziness that <b><i>Chainsaw Man</i></b> is known for, even if the first chapter is more subdued compared to the rest of the series.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Chainsaw Man\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/0f321d1e073cbffc99998345e07c5e721663751744_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When <b><i>Chainsaw Man</i></b> flew onto the screen for the first time in the midst of a very bloody battle, I was both taken aback and reeling in excitement at how the CG team translated the action to the big screen, especially with close-ups of his face.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Kikunosuke Toya makes a sensational voice acting debut as Denji in his first main role ever. Toya really captures Denji’s hopelessness before becoming the titular devil hybrid. As Chainsaw Man, you can still hear Denji inside but the breathing of the Devil feels raw, almost rabid. The conversations between Pochita and Denji were also heartbreakingly beautiful. While Shiori Izawa does sound very much like your typical anime mascot character, the love that Pochita had for Denji shined through majestically.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/09/19-1/chainsaw-man-english-dub-reveals-main-cast-dubbed-trailer\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Chainsaw Man English Dub Reveals Main Cast, Dubbed Trailer</span></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It really helped that throughout the scene with Pochita and Denji that a small beating heart was heard, paired with Kensuke Ushio’s salient soundtrack. All of these elements made for such a nice moment before things got real&nbsp;crazy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In saying that, Pochita definitely stole the show throughout the episode. I didn’t think it was possible to make him any cuter, but here we are. And Makima? Well, you’ll be howling for her even more here. She is perfect.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Chainsaw Man\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/9dfb4091ee24550529d10da4ba46d9531663751760_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><b>The Bloody Aftermath</b></span></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Following the episode was a stage event featuring the four lead voice actors and the director of the series. While we were all in a state of shock from the episode, I was quickly snapped back into the real world thanks to Power’s voice actor Fairouz Ai, who took over the stage with her personality.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While Power wasn’t seen in the first episode, getting a taste of her voice ahead of future episodes was still nice.. The tag team of Denji and Power is just as fun of a read as in the original manga, so getting the chance to preview the banter between Ai and Kikunosuke Toya, Denji’s voice actor, was great.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1GUXu9ns_w&amp;ab_channel=MAPPACHANNEL\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">re-watch the stage event</span></a> for yourself here to relive the fun between the cast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Chainsaw Man World Premiere\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/b251907a0d31c14613fee2216a8b6d711663751795_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 427px;\"></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Official photo of the cast and director</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>During the event, a drink called “ZONe BLOOD,” a collab beverage between the energy drink ZONe and Chainsaw Man, was handed out to guests.

He’s able to channel it throughout his entire being, but when he focuses on a single body part, it can be exceptionally destructive (to himself, as well). It takes its toll, but really packs a wallop.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/06/16/feature-could-science-actually-explain-dekus-one-for-all-quirk-in-my-hero-academia\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>Could Science Actually Explain Deku’s One for All Quirk in My Hero Academia?</strong></span></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>His idol, the Number One Hero <strong>All</strong> <strong>Might</strong>, is a paragon of justice in every way imaginable.

He’s tasked with going undercover to prevent war from erupting between the two nations of Westalis and Ostania. In order to achieve this, he needs to investigate Donovan Desmond, the Leader of the National Unity Party, who's considered to be a threat to the truce between the East and the West.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/07/05/feature-spy-x-familys-loid-and-yor-forger-are-great-spies-and-better-parents\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">SPY x FAMILY's Loid and Yor Forger Are Great Spies and Better Parents</span></a></strong></p>\n\n<p><br>\nTo get close to his target, Twilight needs to create a front family within a week. He assumes the identity of a psychiatrist named Loid Forger and adopts a six-year-old child named Anya to enroll her into Eden Academy, the elite school that Donovan’s son attends. However, Anya has a secret of her own — she's a telepath who can read people's minds.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nThe true origins of Anya are unclear, but what was revealed so far is that she is the result of a research experiment by an unknown organization. She was formerly known as Test Subject 007 and was treated with cruelty and strictness. After her escape, she continued to search for a place to call home, but she was adopted four times and returned back to the orphanages until Loid Forger showed up.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/92710269496b024b3c35ae6d38e66c0a1663191496_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p><br>\nAnya reads his mind and learns the truth about Loid’s mission. This means she’s able to act accordingly and avoid being returned to the orphanage. Loid proceeds to get her into Eden Academy to move on with Operation Strix, but without both parents, it’s not possible to pass the mandatory family interview. Loid now has to secure a wife to complete this mission. Enter Yor Briar.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/07/04-1/feature-more-tough-as-nails-anime-women-like-spy-x-familys-yor-forger\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">More Tough As Nails Anime Women Like SPY x FAMILY's Yor Forger</span></a></strong></p>\n\n<p><br>\nFrom the outside Yor appears to be a sweet, ordinary clerk at Berlint City Hall. Unbeknownst to everyone, she leads a double life as a ruthless assassin known as Thorn Princess. To conceal her identity, she agrees to start a pretend family with Loid. No one in the Forger family is aware of their true identities… well, except for Anya.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:26px;\">Friends or Foes?</span></strong><br>\n&nbsp;</h1>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/e332cc82e2864e745bab7916c8cfc9181663191692_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p><br>\nEvery protagonist needs a trusted associate and the Forgers are no exception. For Loid, there’s Franky Franklin, his partner in crime who’s always there to back him up with whatever is needed — especially if there’s cash involved. From gathering intel to taking care of Anya, Franky will show up and show out!</p>\n\n<p><br>\nThen there’s Yuri Briar, Yor’s younger brother who reveals the deeper story behind Yor becoming an assassin. Yor had to take care of and provide for Yuri after their parents died. Because of this, Yuri grew up to be extremely protective of his older sister, swearing to do anything to keep her safe. This includes trying to protect her from Loid, who he suspects to be untrustworthy. Yuri is a member of the secret police and keeps his job a secret from Yor, pretending to be a civil worker at the foreign ministry.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/06/10/deep-dive-spy-x-familys-retro-style-is-both-iconic-and-true-to-history\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">SPY x FAMILY's Retro Style Is Both Iconic And True To History</span></a></strong></p>\n\n<p><br>\nAnya ends up finding her greatest ally while attending Eden Academy and trying to help Loid with his mission. In order for the mission to succeed, Loid needs to get close to Desmond. The easiest way to do that is by letting Anya strike a friendship with his second son, Damian. This is easier said than done, as all of Anya’s attempts end in vain. However, this does lead to Anya becoming friends with a wealthy young girl named Becky Blackbell. Becky often helps Anya, especially when she's being teased by Damian's group.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:26px;\">Catch a Stella Star</span></strong><br>\n&nbsp;</h1>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/790dbc60dbe8266415127ff4484de7c71663192042_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p><br>\nEden College offers elite education in varied fields. The students who perform better than the rest are considered Imperial Scholars. Here is where we enter into the second phase of Operation Strix. Loid needs to attend a social gathering which is only open to Imperial Scholars and their parents. This means Anya must rise to the occasion and become an honor student.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nLet’s get one thing straight, Anya’s disdain for studying is a real struggle that puts Operation Strix at risk. Constantly. To be an Imperial Scholar, a student must earn eight&nbsp;Stella Stars, which are awarded for high grades and good deeds to society. And what did Anya do? She got a Tonitrus Bolt on her first day by punching, wait for it… Damian — yes, the boy she needs to become friends with. By the way, Tonitrus Bolts are given to students with poor grades and who exhibit bad behavior.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/05/02/feature-6-adorable-anime-daughters-youll-love-as-much-as-spy-x-familys-anya\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">6 Adorable Anime Daughters You'll Love As Much As SPY x FAMILY's Anya</span></a></strong></p>\n\n<p><br>\nThis puts Twilight in crisis mode as he now has to find a way to put the mission back on track.

She’s torn between an unlimited supply of peanuts or something much grander, like a doggie. Her wish may be granted in the next cour. We get a glimpse of a big white dog in what looks to be a corrupted animal shelter. The good boy conjures up a vision of the Forgers, who are all smiles, and hints at gaining a new addition to the family.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nWhat’s interesting is that we hear the two workers in the shelter talk about “revolutionaries” who seem to have sinister plans to use the animals as bomb dogs.

But recently,<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em> </em></span><em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> creator Eiichiro Oda announced, after a long-deserved break for a month, he was going to be heading into the manga's \"<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/06/08/one-piece-manga-confirms-entrance-into-the-final-act\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">final act</span></a>.\" After the conclusion of the lengthy and momentous Wano arc, <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> is finally entering its endgame. This story, which celebrates its twenty-fifth year in July 2022, is a far cry from the narrative that Oda intended to produce at first. Long-time fans may remember it was originally going to <a href=\"https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/%27one-piece%27-author-claims-a-certain-seven-villains-extended-the-series-far-longer-than-he-intended\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">last for around five years</span></a>&nbsp;when he first started it and that he kept it going because he thought the idea of&nbsp;Seven Warlords of the Sea sounded too cool to NOT expand his series for another two decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So was it gonna be as simple as the Straw Hats lining up Mihawk, Crocodile, Kuma, Hancock, Doflamingo, Moria and Jimbei and knocking them out like video game bosses until a \"The End\" screen appeared? Nope. In a 2007 interview with the Yomiuri Shimbun, Oda said&nbsp;he was gonna keep it going <a href=\"https://archive.fo/20080621032029/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/book/news/20070725bk07.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">for as long as it took for Luffy's journey</span></a> to finish. I adore how cryptic that is. I can only one day hope to go up to my boss and say \"The spreadsheet I'm working on will be finished when the journey of Column A Row 3 is complete.\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Luffy, One Piece\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/8931c1c8e522ac8c637b0cf8538e1e341612562684_main.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In 2009, though, Oda went from cryptic to realistic, stating in an interview with the Japanese magazine MEN'S NON-NO <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> probably won't end \"<a href=\"http://www.thegrandline.com/odanon.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">for a long time.</span></a>\" In 2009, Oda was wading through Impel Down and the Marineford War, so it sounds pretty fitting&nbsp;he killed off Ace and thought \"Yeah, this is gonna take a while.\" Then, in 2012, Oda admitted&nbsp;if he wrote everything in<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"> </span><em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> that he wanted to, <a href=\"http://forums.arlongpark.net/showthread.php?t=42229&amp;highlight=end+date\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">it would \"never come to an end</span></a>.\" That's right. There are over 1050&nbsp;chapters of <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> and IT'S THE ABRIDGED VERSION.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That said, Oda&nbsp;did say in a 2012&nbsp;issue of <em><strong>One Piece Shimbun</strong></em> the series was <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2016-07-20/one-piece-manga-creator-eiichiro-oda-story-is-about-65-percent-finished/.104500\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">around 60% done</span></a>. Jump ahead to 2016, though, and it's only 65% finished. Greg, who is the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ochimusha108\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">One Piece columnist at Shueisha and Toei</span></a>&nbsp;and participates in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnePiecePodcast\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">terrific One Piece Podcast</span></a>, mentioned a few days later that actually, Oda stated&nbsp;it was<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.onepiecepodcast.com/2016/07/23/one-piece-actually-70-story-probably/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">70% done in an&nbsp;interview&nbsp;with Fuji TV</span></a>. He also mentioned whenever these percentages are brought up, Oda is talking about the amount of story left, and that we're not dealing with actual time. And that's great news for me because math is scary.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Robin, One Piece\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/1426c89fea8e21a7ef8fbe2f57ed77991560291832_full.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, Oda said in a&nbsp;Yomiuri Shimbun&nbsp;interview&nbsp;<em><strong>One Piece</strong></em><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/culture/subcul/20180723-OYT8T50083/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">was 80%&nbsp;finished</span></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>a number that did line up with his 2019&nbsp;interview with the members of the comedy group Fischer's where he stated that he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTgvB0Vpyxk\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">wants it to end after five years</span></a>. It also corroborated the 2020 forecast that it would conclude in <a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/08/27-1/eiichiro-oda-claims-there-is-4-to-5-years-left-of-the-one-piece-manga\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">\"four to&nbsp;five years.\"</span></a>&nbsp; His very loose five-year plan at the beginning has evolved into a very loose five-year plan to end <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> and now, with him throwing the word \"final\" around, it finally seems like <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> might actually be reaching the finish line.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But I think the thing we need to take away from all of this, more than any number, is Oda stating&nbsp;<em><strong>One Piece</strong></em><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"> </span>will finish \"<a href=\"https://getnews.jp/archives/2063282\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">as I please.</span></a>\" Personally, I'm pretty grateful for the circumstances of Oda's magnum opus. So few creators are granted the time and publication space to finish long stories on their terms. So few are able to keep up with the trying work conditions involved in the manga industry. <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> is truly a once-in-a-lifetime story.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"One Piece\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/e93e15365ec0985732d5d81c705892e51642446234_main.jpg\" style=\"height: 360px; width: 640px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So often, when a creator does become attached to a particular story or brand for a long time (with Oda, twenty-five years, plus the earlier years where he was working the kinks of the <em><strong>Romance Dawn</strong></em> story out), one or two things end up occurring: There is some kind of fan backlash because they feel they're unable to maintain the quality of the beloved story&nbsp;or they jump to the backseat and let someone else take the wheel. With Oda and <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em>, neither has happened. <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em> remains intensely popular and adored.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It's hard to imagine my life without <em><strong>One Piece</strong></em>. It's been a part of it for fifteen years now, and with a destination on the horizon, I'm not sad about its end, but grateful that I got to experience the cruise. It's not just become one of the greatest stories that I've ever experienced but an awe-inspiring testament to the power of a creator being able to deliver their work on their terms.

Superteams of this caliber assemble with such scarcity that their legend is spoken of in hushed whispers for years to come. For the junior high circuit of Tokyo, that superteam was Teiko.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Generation of Miracles of <a href=\"http://www.crunchyroll.com/kurokos-basketball/episode-1-winter-cup-highlights-shadow-and-light-part-1-723503?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=kurobas_en&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_kurobas_en\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em><strong>Kuroko’s Basketball</strong></em></span></a> was a lineup of prodigious ballers capable of impossible feats of athleticism. Captained by their stone-faced point guard, Seijuro Akashi, the starting five of Teiko could blow out opponents in any number of ways. The only thing lacking was a unified love for the game, and upon graduation, they would all go their separate ways, destined to meet again as bitter rivals. Their high school duels would become just as legendary, with each acting as their team’s respective star player, but who among them could truly be considered the king of the court? It’s time to put them to the test and determine who among the Generation of Miracles is the greatest baller of them all.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>NOTE: Due to severe misconduct, former Teiko forward Shogo Haizaki will not be acknowledged in this listing in any way, shape, or form. His tenure had ended in disgrace before the Generation of Miracles had truly formed, and more importantly, he stole my lunch one time.</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:26px;\"><strong>6.

According to Ryota Kise and Atsushi Murasakibarra, his name is ‘Kurokocchi’ or ‘Kuro-chin’ or something. Honestly, they’re probably just pulling my leg.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/10/27-1/kurokos-basketball-anime-heads-to-the-court-in-granrodeos-10th-anniversary-music-video\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Kuroko's Basketball Anime Heads to the Court in GRANRODEO's 10th Anniversary Music Video</span></a></strong></em></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I’m not fond of dealing in gossip, but word on the street is that this enigmatic sixth man was adept at dealing lightning-quick passes that amplified the skills of anyone he played with. He was otherwise a non-factor as an offensive option, and overall, an unspectacular young man who would go largely unnoticed by his peers. With that in mind, we cannot anoint this ‘Kuroko’ fellow as anything more than a footnote in the legend of Teiko. That being said, if this \"phantom\" business is true, this Kuroko person could be a fantastic <em>shadow</em> to someone’s light.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:26px;\"><strong>5.

Leaving him open is a concession that you would like to lose the game badly, but he is also fast and shifty enough to lose would-be defenders. Midorima is able to commence his shot before the ball has even landed in his hands. It’s quite a sight to see, and I fear that if any of us were to attempt this in real life we would just end up embarrassed.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/10/15/players-gather-in-the-first-slam-dunk-anime-movie-visual\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Players Gather in THE FIRST SLAM DUNK Anime Movie Visual</span></a></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Despite this, his particular skill requires more setup from his teammates than the other Teiko alumni. Shutting down the other players can spell disaster for this verdant sharpshooter, and though he can create for himself to a degree, he is the only member of the Generation of Miracles not known to have ever dunked or entered \"The Zone.\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Even if Midorima were to dunk, he’d probably suck all the fun out of it somehow.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:26px;\"><strong>4.

Kise has gone so far as to declare that “he may be the most naturally talented of the five of us.” In one game during his tenure with Teiko, he scored 100 points!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Alas, I don’t hand out trophies for talent as Murasakibara’s mercurial temperament will dictate whether he’ll make any effort whatsoever. He might elect to only play defense or request he be subbed out of the game entirely. If apathy were a person, it wouldn’t even be him, because he wouldn’t bother turning up to prove that point. He's basically the antithesis of Midorima. If they were to swap bodies, Murasakibara would be a distant fifth in this ranking — without his physical blessings&nbsp;he would be nothing more than an enthusiasm sinkhole.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:26px;\"><strong>3.

Don’t make the critical mistake of teaching him the ropes, however, as he will use those ropes to tie you in knots. Kise is an observant player who repurposes other people’s abilities for his own, emulating them so well that he's actually able to iron out their flaws and refine them into perfect techniques. His potential is nigh limitless, and someday he could very well become the greatest basketball player the world has ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The only things holding him back at the moment are a comparative lack of experience and the fact that pulling off his <em>Perfect Copy</em>&nbsp;exhausts a great deal of energy. Impressive as it may be, it’s not dependable for long stretches of gameplay. Additionally, Kise has not yet shown the capacity to be a leader for his squad, humbly deferring to others. This is perhaps to his own detriment, but it does, at the very least, earn him valuable cute points.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:26px;\"><strong>2.

At first glance, he is an unassuming playmaker and floor general, but his hypnotic Emperor Eye renders opponents reeling in his path.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Trying to quantify where he ranks on this list is a tricky bit of business. On skill or physical acumen alone he would lose badly to any of the other members of the Generation of Miracles. The thing that makes him so unstoppable, most fittingly, is his power to stop others. Beyond that, he simultaneously motivates and manipulates his teammates, driving them to perform at their best. It’s no surprise that he made Teiko the fearsome beasts that they were as even the most defiant of personalities would bend to his will.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/02/21-1/kuroko-and-kagami-take-a-timeout-in-kurokos-basketball-10th-anniversary-teaser-anime-visual\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Kuroko and Kagami Take a Timeout in Kuroko's Basketball 10th Anniversary Teaser Anime Visual</span></a></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Why, then, does this master strategist fall short of the top spot? It comes down to a lack of resilience. His pride is absolute and he has more checks and balances to control the tempo of a single game than most would plan in a season. Should someone bypass all of these master plans, he can become dumbstruck, even frantic.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Don’t tell him I said that.

If you somehow found yourself in the perfect position to block his shot he’d simply contort in midair to score around you. As he once said, “the only one who can beat me, is me,” which is a bit ironic when he ends up losing to Taiga Kagami — who basically is Aomine <em>but redder</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/07/26/quiz-which-sports-anime-should-you-watch-next\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Which Sports Anime Should You Watch Next?</span></a></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The menacing power forward is an isolation-heavy ace player, bullying defenders with his superior physicality. His capability to access the vaunted \"Zone\" is perhaps the most unsurprising as such a concept seems tailor-made for someone of his talent threshold. His style is unorthodox and his will is oppressive, and though playing on the same team as him may reduce you to a mere spectator, the results are indisputable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">The championship has been decided and the confetti is littered across the court… But what do you think?

It’s a consistent routine I’ve got going and one I’ve come to appreciate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To my surprise, the fourth episode of this balls-to-the-wall anime decided to demonstrate how nice it is to have a part of your day that’s solely yours and/or shared with someone who’s adopted the same vibe.

It’s a major highlight, not just in the episode but in the series itself so far. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Chainsaw Man</strong></em> is full of gloriously bloody action, frightening creature designs and protagonists you’d want to keep on a leash when walking around with them because you <em>know</em> they’re gonna get into trouble. The beginning of the fourth episode is a reminder of the mayhem of the series. Just when you think Denji’s won, another devil appears to pick up where the last one left off. Denji can’t turn into the titular character, too low on blood from the last battle. He keeps fighting, though, and holds his own for as long as he can. Fortunately, Aki shows up and ends things with a single command.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Aki in Chainsaw Man\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/0479974cd84913467a385c726c8dbf0f1667412775_main.png\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>From there we get a <em>bit</em> of quiet — but not really. Denji’s recovering, but the conversation is serious. Power set him up to be killed by the Bat Devil. Aki knows that Denji’s covering for her for some reason, and he knows that he has to tell Makima something about what happened. Things are worked out eventually, leading to Aki waking up the next day and going about his business.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This brings us the scene I referenced earlier. For a couple of minutes we watch Aki get out of bed, wash his face, brush his teeth, make himself a cup of coffee, and go out and read the paper. That’s all that happens. Every part of his morning is animated with just as much care as the anime’s more crucial moments. The colored swirls of Aki’s toothpaste. Him grating his coffee beans before dumping them into a filter and gently pouring in hot water. Him enjoying the morning breeze from his balcony. It’s a complete contrast to what we’ve seen in the series so far and I love it just as much as I love everything else in <em><strong>Chainsaw Man</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/11/01-1/chainsaw-man-anime-releases-fourth-ending-video-featuring-tooboe\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Chainsaw Man Anime Releases Fourth Ending Video Featuring TOOBOE</span></a></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say we haven’t gotten any downtime with these characters, there’s just always something else going on. Makima embraces Denji after he slaughters a horde of zombies, but that comes with her making a deal with him. Denji getting to finally enjoy toast and jam is loud, messy and paired with Aki’s annoyed scowl. Power enjoying time with Meowy involves massacring animals for food and the Bat Devil snatching her cat away. There hasn’t been much of anything that just lets a character BE... until now.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Denji in Chainsaw Man\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/15495f8583edc181d7f64a2772b435b51667413239_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Having something that’s <em>regular</em> and <em>yours</em> is important. It’s not just Aki we see this with. This scene also shows Denji waking up and going about his day less chaotically than when he first got to Aki’s place. The calm morning has obviously had an effect on him. I dare say Denji’s gotten comfortable — something he sorely needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As Aki does laundry and vacuums, Denji simply eats his toast. The bread isn’t as haphazard as it was in Episode 2, the table and utensils are clean and Denji is just... quiet. The two are also civil toward each other, with Aki cutting up the ingredients to make curry for lunch. It’s nice to see the two getting along, but it’s also a genuinely relatable moment. After all the heart-pounding action in your life, you really do want to drink coffee, read the paper and clean your place. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve felt pure bliss from putting groceries away or seeing my favorite bubble bath brand on sale.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/10/14-1/roundup-chainsaw-man-anime-hype-hits-celebrities-xbox-and-the-us-consumer-product-safety-commission\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Chainsaw Man Anime Hype Hits Celebrities, Xbox and… the US Consumer Product Safety Commission?</span></a></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This all goes out the window when Power shows up, providing a comical level of disorganization that makes you feel for Aki. That being said, it’s interesting to see Denji being the voice of reason in regard to taking care of the house. Before, it had been Aki telling him not to choose violence, but now Aki gets to watch as Denji tells Power to respect vegetables and flush the toilet. I get the feeling the tranquility of Aki’s apartment will do some good if its effect on Denji is any indication.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I wasn’t expecting this kind of character interaction in a series where a guy can have a chainsaw erupt from his forehead, but in an anime so wild, I’m here for the tranquil moments. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://got.cr/CSMPremiumTrial-NewsBanner\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/e23801b7f6f4824a5eb494b18f3fd72b1667413931_main.png\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 43px;\"></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Briana Lawrence is the Senior EN Features Editor here at Crunchyroll.

Both Miorine and her <em><strong>Revolutionary Girl Utena</strong></em> parallel Anthy begin the series trapped in systems beyond their control, forced to act as prizes and brides for whoever proves their worth in combat. Even the structural system of Suletta fighting off one duelist after another for Miorine&rsquo;s hand echoes <em><strong>Revolutionary Girl Utena</strong></em>&rsquo;s episodic foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond these broad narrative strokes, the similarities to&nbsp;<em><strong>Revolutionary Girl Utena</strong></em>&nbsp;continue on the micro level through conceits like Miorine&rsquo;s greenhouse and tomato garden. Just like Anthy had her private flower garden, Miorine has a private sanctuary that she is fiercely defensive of, a small patch of earth where she can express her own will. Even the temperament of each story&rsquo;s first top duelist seems similar with Holder Guel effortlessly evoking the violent masculine insecurity of&nbsp;<em><strong>Utena</strong></em>&rsquo;s Saionji. And I&rsquo;m frankly not sure which series&rsquo; version of Chuchu would be more offended by a comparison to their doppelganger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/fa417c4243c3a9afde5500b0ef38d6261667068491_main.png\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, there&rsquo;s so far been little indication that&nbsp;<em><strong>Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury</strong></em>&nbsp;will follow&nbsp;<em><strong>Revolutionary Girl Utena</strong></em>&rsquo;s path on a&nbsp;<em>thematic</em>&nbsp;level, diving into specific questions of adolescent identity-forming and gender relations. While the scaffolding is similar, the new <em><strong>Gundam</strong></em>&rsquo;s active drama seems far more concerned with the economic machinations of its overseers than any sort of intimate social critique. Miorine seemed to affirm this herself in the very first episode, stating that a relationship between her and Suletta would only parse as scandalous to someone from a distant backwater. Still, the possibility is certainly there for future parallels to emerge in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of backwaters, while Miorine&rsquo;s character has largely been framed through touchstones reminiscent of&nbsp;<em><strong>Revolutionary Girl Utena</strong></em>, Suletta&rsquo;s backstory seems far more indebted to Shakespeare&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><strong>The Tempest</strong></em>. This is most glaringly apparent in the choices of Suletta-adjacent character names: the wily sorcerer Prospero has here been shifted to Prospera (maintaining their role as the heroine&rsquo;s single parent), while the magical spirit Ariel has kept its name largely intact, only shifting one letter to become Suletta&rsquo;s mobile suit Aerial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/cd75f0952ee77a4bd3f6582fe55746bf1667068531_main.png\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond their suspiciously similar names, Prospera&rsquo;s plan also echoes the mechanics of Prospero&rsquo;s own scheme. Like him, she has been &ldquo;deposed&rdquo; from her rightful authority (this time framed in terms of corporations rather than a dukeship) and banished to a remote outpost. From there, both Prospero and Prospera eventually hatch a plan to have their child get close to the child of their nemesis, thereby returning them to their rightful glory. Thrust out into this strange world on her mother&rsquo;s orders, Suletta&rsquo;s every word and action seems to echo the baffled, frightened, yet deeply curious words of her Shakespearian counterpart: &ldquo;oh brave new world, that has such people in it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the absurd density of adjacent names, concepts, and visual touchstones, it seems hard to deny that Okouchi is deliberately evoking the specter of both&nbsp;<em><strong>Revolutionary Girl Utena</strong></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><strong>The Tempest</strong></em>. But while it&rsquo;s easy enough to point to areas of commonality, deciphering precisely&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;he&rsquo;s making such strong allusions to these secondary texts is a significantly trickier question. So what can we actually draw or decipher from these references?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/813507c237f364b40661efff03fc01d21667068570_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First off, one natural consequence of these choices is precisely what we&rsquo;re doing right now: noticing these textual links, and thereby keeping them in mind when engaging with and analyzing&nbsp;<em><strong>Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury</strong></em>. This is one of the great and most obvious powers of intertextual references; through signifiers like charged name choices or familiar imagery, a thoughtful writer can overlay an entire secondary text&rsquo;s web of meanings on their own work, creating a more robust thematic conversation through the interactions between them. One work can only contain so many ideas and themes without toppling upon itself; by skillfully employing references to key secondary texts, great fiction can stand on the shoulders of giants, engaging in a conversation that expands beyond its own boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/10/13/recs-plug-in-with-the-perfect-weekly-watching-schedule?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_news\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Plug in With the Perfect Weekly Watching Schedule</span></a></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, seeing what these texts currently draw from their reference points can also give us some idea of what they might later draw in. In this case, the cruciality of Ariel to&nbsp;<em><strong>The Tempest</strong></em>&rsquo;s drama, as both a force of magic and a captured soul, could well be echoed through the technological significance of Suletta&rsquo;s Gundam. Suletta has already been put on trial for the allegedly heretical technology of her Aerial, with both Prospera and Delling clearly squabbling over the power to control this technology. But given we already know this technology was initially designed for medical work, it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to assume that Aerial&rsquo;s advances might eventually be offered freely to the people, much like&nbsp;<em><strong>The Tempest</strong></em>&rsquo;s Ariel was eventually set free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/f36992e2d46c2b6c45e73b1fb50124f71667068596_main.png\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s only one of the many interesting conjectures you might draw from&nbsp;<em><strong>Mobile Suit Gundam: Witch from Mercury</strong></em>&rsquo;s various textual reference points. With two such rich narratives to draw upon, the series&rsquo; ability to either embrace referential resonance or complicate and comment on its influences seems practically boundless.&nbsp;<em><strong>Revolutionary Girl Utena</strong></em>&rsquo;s commentary on youth and identity feel as urgent today as when the show was first released, while&nbsp;<em><strong>The Tempest</strong></em>&rsquo;s vivid imagery and fantastical narrative make it no surprise that authors through the ages have drawn on its magnetic appeal. Seeing Okouchi embrace such charged points of connection fills me with excitement for what might be yet to come. I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by&nbsp;<em><strong>Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury</strong></em>&rsquo;s progress so far, and can&rsquo;t wait to see what Okouchi has in store for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://got.cr/PremiumTrial-NewsBanner4\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/78f5441d927cf160a93e037b567c2b1f1595958516_main.png\" style=\"height: 43px; width: 640px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Nick Creamer has been writing about cartoons for too many years now and is always ready to cry about Madoka.

There&rsquo;s an air of mystery surrounding her and she&rsquo;s more likely to keep to herself instead of openly chatting with her teammates. This becomes a problem when she&rsquo;s willing to defy orders and put one of her Lycoris teammates at risk in the very first episode which is, ironically, something else you might expect from an action protagonist.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Lycoris Recoil\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/1eb3faeebed2cbe842e8a1b757c3f8001664830191_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Takina is the very definition of what a Lycoris should be &mdash; minus the part about disregarding orders. Lycoris are assassins who are meant to blend into society and take out their targets without anyone noticing so everyone can live peacefully. That&rsquo;s why they wear school uniforms, because as the show describes, who would think anything was out of the ordinary with a student? Even though Takina gets into a lot of hot water for her actions in the first episode, her combat skills are top-notch, making her a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/09/08/lycoris-recoil-anime-spin-off-novel-reaches-100000-copies-even-before-its-release\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Lycoris Recoil Anime Spin-Off Novel Reaches 100,000 Copies Even Before Its Release</span></a></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Pairing her with Chisato seems like a recipe for disaster considering how much they differ. Chisato is much more free-natured and bubbly while Takina is serious and straight-laced. Despite her easy-going persona, Chisato would be considered a better combat specialist than Takina given how she can evade bullets. Having an artificial heart has made her more adept at fighting, and it&rsquo;s also given her a &ldquo;mission&rdquo; she needs to figure out at some point.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Lycoris Recoil\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/839baf7c40f7581394d329275641b2b01664830215_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The pair differ even more when it comes to how they approach combat. Chisato is intent on&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>killing or causing grave injuries to her enemies. She uses rubber bullets and takes the time to make sure people are OK if they&rsquo;re injured. This makes her more visible to her targets, which is not how a Lycoris typically behaves. A Lycoris is supposed to operate from the shadows and doesn&rsquo;t care at all about their enemy&rsquo;s condition after a fight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Chisato does things on her own terms &mdash; and those terms are in direct conflict with what she&rsquo;s supposed to be. This adds an intriguing element to her character, especially when you think about the advantages she has.&nbsp; It&rsquo;d be easy for her to completely overpower any enemy&nbsp;she comes across, but&nbsp;she&rsquo;s decided to be empathetic instead of being a destroyer. That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d expect from the quintessential action star, but again, Chisato breaks that mold.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Lycoris Recoil\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/b9e36d2e65c895a164f7afdefdc7dff71664830834_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Then? Episode 6 happens.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the sixth episode, Chisato gets kidnapped and isn&rsquo;t able to fight to her fullest. She&rsquo;s beaten and even blinded by her enemies, but throughout all of that, she doesn&rsquo;t try to fight in a way that would be advantageous to her, such as using more lethal techniques to truly take out a lot of the enemies that are surrounding her, which would mean taking Majima &mdash; the man behind the recent terrorist attacks aimed at taking out Lycoris &mdash; out for good. Luckily she&rsquo;s saved, but even in such a terrible situation, she fights how she normally would and doesn&rsquo;t change her ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/08/23/lycoris-recoil-anime-spin-off-novel-gets-reprinted-before-publication-due-to-demand\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Lycoris Recoil Anime Spin-Off Novel Gets Reprinted Before Publication Due to Demand</span></a></strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Chisato&rsquo;s ideology has a positive effect on Takina. Chisato&rsquo;s way of doing things helps Takina break out of the Lycoris mold that she&rsquo;d been in. She gains a new perspective on how she should tackle missions and is able to see that the objective doesn&rsquo;t have to be purely elimination. Thanks to Chisato, Takina begins to open up instead of being strictly cold and calculating. Without Chisato, it&rsquo;s hard to see where Takina could have ended up after her dismissal from DA after putting her teammates in danger during the first episode. Takina was incredibly lost because being a Lycoris had been her life up to that point and now that had been taken away from her. She&rsquo;s now&nbsp;found a new path in her life thanks to Chisato and the empathetic nature of Chisato is slowly starting to rub off on her.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Lycoris Recoil\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/5beaf2090a8899efa460d2f1d54398fe1664830289_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Having Chisato be a more empathetic action protagonist takes an already fun show and makes it far more intriguing as a whole.&nbsp;<i><strong>Lycoris Recoil</strong>&nbsp;</i>could&rsquo;ve easily played out like most action series do, but to take it in this direction allows for a different kind of story. Despite her &ldquo;assassin&rdquo; label, Chisato&rsquo;s able to spread joy and humanity to other characters like Takina who normally wouldn&rsquo;t be able to have such a gift. I&rsquo;m sure as the series progresses there will be enemies who try to exploit this side of Chisato, but she&rsquo;s shown that no matter the circumstance, she&rsquo;ll still look at whoever&rsquo;s against her as not just a person to get rid of, but as a fellow human. That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s able to make this show so intriguing, with how she&rsquo;s able to tackle the morality of the series given how she views her opponents as humans and not just objects in her way.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:13px\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://got.cr/PremiumTrial-NewsBanner4\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/501d1a60b3778bb520619179b0a61f181663896673_main.png\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 43px;\" /></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:13px\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Jared Clemons is a writer and podcaster for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.seasonalanimecheckup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Seasonal Anime Checkup</span></a>&nbsp;and author of One Shining Moment: A Critical Analysis of Love Live!

If you find yourself craving similar anime after your 10-episode run through Night City, then it&#39;ll do you good to watch <em><strong>Akudama Drive</strong></em>. Borrowing many themes from the subgenre of science fiction, the series is both bursting with gaudy colors, eccentric characters, and bustling backgrounds to create an imperfect mess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Swindler with the Akudama\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/f06bd5d9b95401b8fb2f44bea6f6226b1662759161_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kazutaka Kodaka, the creator of the visual novel turned anime series, <a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/danganronpa-the-animation/episode-1-prologue-welcome-to-despair-high-school-738575?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=catalog_en&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_catalog_en\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em><strong>Danganronpa</strong></em></span></a>, helped conceptualize the series along with writer Norimitsu Kaiho. This mash-up brought beautiful chaos with each slice of the story, with each episode containing evident influences of cyberpunk as well as the backdrop of a dystopian Kanto.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The series follows six central characters, all called to attention with titles instead of names &mdash; Ordinary Person, Courier, Doctor, Hoodlum, Cutthroat, Hacker, and Brawler, with Ordinary Person being the character the audience follows the most. After being mistakenly accused of not paying for food, she happens to meet the six Akudama &mdash; a group of dangerous criminals with various bounties on their heads &mdash; and is nearly killed by them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To avoid being killed, she decides to don the new name &quot;Swindler&quot; and is somehow roped into an even bigger problem. Guided by a talking black cat, the Akudama and Swindler &mdash; who is now assumed to be one of them &mdash; are ordered to infiltrate the Shinkansen to steal important cargo. What the cargo of the bullet train is, exactly, no one knows. On top of that, they&#39;re all forced to wear collars that could kill them with a single push of a button. They all need to work together to not only live, but earn a large payday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"The black cat in Akudama Drive\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/48f4ba82fefe9fb07b4a639384163b361662759213_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/12/09/akudama-drive-and-danganronpa-cross-over-in-animedia-cover-art\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Akudama Drive and Danganronpa Cross Over in Animedia Cover Art</span></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most unique thing about <em><strong>Akudama Drive</strong></em> is the characters and how they attempt to make it through the dire situation they&#39;ve been forced into. Everyone acts exactly as their name implies, which makes the expected, frankly, unexpected. Even Swindler, the most &quot;normal&quot; character out of the bunch, happens to talk her way out of multiple situations despite seemingly being what she was at the beginning of the show: an ordinary person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other examples include Courier, whose policy is to make a delivery to respective recipients no matter what happens. Your first thought, though, wouldn&#39;t be that he&#39;d literally do anything, even crash through multiple buildings, to do so. Meanwhile, Doctor will &ldquo;save&rdquo; a patient with or without their consent, but ends up killing even more people in the process. Even Cutthroat, who from the first scene is shown to be extremely mentally disturbed, is shown to have both a childlike innocence and sharp self-awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Cutthroat in Akudama Drive\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/7f12d6711b93620340a16dfc1724e26b1662759263_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/01/06-1/original-tv-anime-akudama-drive-gets-stage-play-adaptation-in-march\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Original TV Anime Akudama Drive Gets Stage Play Adaptation</span></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strongest point of the series is not only the characters but the worldbuilding and multiple twists that each episode brings. Because no one knows what&#39;s going to happen, it makes each episode fresh and exciting. As the Akudama get closer to unveiling secrets after attaining the cargo, however, the Execution Division is sent after them. The aptly named Execution Division Master and Execution Division Pupil introduce the &quot;antagonists&quot; of the series, with that meaning being extremely ambiguous because <em><strong>Akudama Drive</strong></em> is a series that constantly loves to make you ask, &ldquo;Who are the good guys here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The series follows a group of criminals of all varying degrees, from the worst of the worst to the misguided, and even the petty thieves. Despite that, <em><strong>Akudama Drive</strong></em> somehow sends a message that wouldn&#39;t make sense if you were to take out any one of those characters. Some of the main themes of other well-known cyberpunk series are about the fragility of humanity, technology overtaking the world or some parts of it, and how the government may control way too much in the ways of the world and corruption within it. The main theme of <em><strong>Akudama Drive</strong></em> is, ironically, justice, and how it deserves to be served.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Swindler can be argued to be the only character amongst the Akudama to even remotely be thinking about justice, her conception of what is right and wrong isn&#39;t all black and white, either, as she tries to make sense of the circumstances she&#39;s unwillingly become a part of. As Swindler struggles to live through multiple death battles or do something simple like finding something to eat, you can&#39;t help but cheer her on as her story progresses. This is because anyone can be &quot;Ordinary Person&quot; and become &quot;Swindler,&quot; which makes her situation even more intriguing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Swindler in Akudama Drive\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/29fa2cfa492bf8734caa022f51c57b291662759345_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/04/16/feature-what-makes-akudama-drives-ending-so-compelling\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">What Makes Akudama Drive&rsquo;s Ending So Compelling?</span></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">With the character interactions, the ridiculousness of the entire situation, and the morally gray box that everyone can be put in, <em><strong>Akudama Drive</strong></em> steels itself as a cyberpunk adventure to remember.

You may think about the intimidating beasts that are the Evas themselves or even the strong cast led by Shinji, Asuka and Rei.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">But then you hear a jazz beat and the opening notes of Fly Me to the Moon or the choral and lyrical opening to Cruel Angel&rsquo;s Thesis, and you can practically sing these songs from memory. For many at this point,&nbsp;Fly Me to the Moon is more associated with Evangelion than Frank Sinatra. Maybe you hear the thunderous, drumming tension built up by the &ldquo;Angel Attack&rdquo; theme and you can picture your favorite battle from the series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/413ddcd92d6d8b5cff9270feff815bd01662495875_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-align: center;\"><em>Image via <a href=\"https://kyodotokyo.com/pr/eva-ws2022.html\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Kyototokyo.com</span></a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">The point is, even while the story and characters may be usual representations of this franchise, it&rsquo;s the music that can evoke the strongest memories for this beloved, personal creation. Since its release, Yoko Takahashi waved the flag by performing the most iconic music from the series at multiple events in Japan and around the world. The soundtrack, as well, has similarly made its mark at various music halls around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">Some of these are simple symphonic concerts allowing fans to hear the music performed live by a real orchestra, while others reinterpret the music into something altogether unique and entrancing. This was the case in Osaka in August, as fans came out in force for the Wind Symphony performance of music from across 25 years of Evangelion.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KV1R_8OnxI0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Original 2019 promotional video for the concert series</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The symphony was taking place at the Osaka Festival Hall, the city&rsquo;s biggest symphony hall situated just outside the main city center. The first performance was held in Tokyo in 2018, performed by the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra, and immediately sold out due to high demand. It had initially been planned to return for a new round of performances in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya in 2020 (with the latter two dates performed by the Osaka Shion Wind Orchestra). Alas, due to COVID, plans changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over two years after the initially-planned date for the concerts, the performance was finally held, featuring songs from the TV series, <em><strong>Rebuild</strong></em> movies and <em><strong>3.0+1.0</strong></em>. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, Yoko Takahashi herself would appear at the event with the legendary singer set to perform some of her songs from the series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arriving at the venue exuded a refined atmosphere you would expect from a venue typically attuned to Beethoven and Ebner than <em><strong>Evangelion</strong></em>. Still, the abundance of fans in Evangelion and more casual attire ensured the event felt more relaxed than one would expect. The Festival Hall is an impressive yet modern venue (opening for the first time in 2013!), with a large wooden stage for the orchestra and walls shaped in a manner to most effectively capture and reverberate the sound around the venue for all 2700 attendees for the sold-out event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/7e54a9991ec1cc8ae4277afc4f3a66341662387905_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 480px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Osaka Festival Hall (Photo: Alicia Haddick)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the wind orchestra took to their seats and tuned their instruments, the roaring battle cry of &ldquo;Angel Attack&rdquo; sucked you right into Shinji&rsquo;s first fight in EVA-01 with an angel in TOKYO-3 setting the stage for the show to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What struck me was just how much these songs were successfully able to bring you into the world of Evangelion without a single visual reminder of the series within the venue. Unlike some other modern venues, there was no projection or screen where footage of key moments could be shown with the music, yet you were still immersed and lost in the music regardless. Without a screen, it was easier to simply allow the musicians and your imagination to guide you through the performance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same can be said when Yoko Takahashi took the stage. While I have seen her perform live in the past, I was struck by her command over the stage even as she worked with an entire orchestra. &quot;Tensions -welcome to the stage-&quot;, the song she performed as she made her entrance, transformed this powerful insert song into a tense battle between singer and backing that elevated the song to new heights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Osaka Wind Orchestra\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/49bb2cc2b42f53e5287665b725771b001662495952_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 427px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Osaka Shion Wind Orchestra (Image via <a href=\"https://kyodotokyo.com/pr/eva-ws2022.html\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Kyototokyo.com</span></a>)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concert could lower this intensity when needed, as seen with the more calm 5-piece quintet renditions of &ldquo;Thanatos&rdquo; and &ldquo;Both of You, Dance Like You Want to Win&rdquo; and the haunting full-orchestra rendition of Rei&rsquo;s theme. Yet the wonder of hearing the song that brings the <em><strong>Rebuild</strong></em> series to a soaring close in &ldquo;What If&rdquo; performed live in orchestra and song stuck out as a highlight amidst it all. The song&rsquo;s presence in the final Rebuild film as a soaring piece of closure that transforms the nihilism of the original into a step forward is truly brought out when performed live on such a scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturally, the concert had to come to an end with the classics. Takahashi stayed on stage to perform the song many had been waiting for, A Cruel Angel&rsquo;s Thesis, before surprising the crowd with two extra songs. Closing out the concert, perhaps most fittingly, was a performance of Fly Me to the Moon and an extended, bouncy rendition of the next episode theme. Call it fan service, service!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the new end of Evangelion behind us, the series is stepping forward into an unpredictable future, with Hideaki Anno moving beyond the franchise at last for new projects like his reimagination of Japanese kid classics like <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/en-gb/anime-feature/2022/05/19/review-shin-ultramans-fanatic-and-hope-filled-entry-in-the-shin-universe?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=article_driven&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_news_article_driven\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">Ultraman</span></a></strong></em> and Kamen Rider. This concert, similarly, felt like it approached the series by recognizing its past but, with the emphasis of new songs from the movie series and its rendition of &ldquo;What If,&rdquo; understood the need to carve a new place for itself and move forwards. It was a chance to celebrate the franchise&rsquo;s music in style, for fans to remember, but for audiences to consider their broader relationship to the series through song in an audience befitting its monumental impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, I love you <em><strong>Evangelion</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://got.cr/PremiumTrial-NewsBanner4\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/78f5441d927cf160a93e037b567c2b1f1595958516_main.png\" style=\"height: 43px; width: 640px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /><em>Alicia Haddick is a freelance features writer for Crunchyroll.

If there&rsquo;s a product in Japan, you can slap a NERV logo on it. But with over 25 years of merchandise under its belt, the history of <b><i>Evangelion</i></b> goods is quite vast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Held from July 15 to August 26 on the ninth floor of Shibuya Hikarie, the <i>Evangelion Crossing Expo </i>looked back at what was most likely the entire merchandising history of the franchise, with over 4,000 unique pieces on display &ndash; there were a lot of canned coffee and pachinko machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><b>Crossing Over to the Evangelion Expo</b></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/fbd4e2a161e9f9e6b9b2e7aa8561e7411661367200_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 415px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been very few times I&rsquo;ve walked into a department store in central Tokyo and been instantly calmed, but the journey from the ever-busy Shibuya Station to the Hikarie felt more <b><i>Evangelion</i></b> as I got closer. Advertising for the exhibition grew intense as I walked through the underground path, but nothing could prepare me for Shiro Sagisu&rsquo;s iconic music blaring through the speakers as I walked into the Hikarie area, instantly transporting me into the world of <b><i>Evangelion</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is ironic: It felt like I had walked straight into Tokyo-3, but was headed straight into a giant warehouse of goods for the series from a third-party perspective. It&rsquo;d be pretty messed up to think that people in the Eva universe would create plush toys of literally angels of destruction. I digress though&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/6468d33c19364330070846c1099d00331661367238_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 358px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before walking into the <i>Evangelion Crossing Expo</i>, I was greeted by the original prints of <b><i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i></b> from the 1990s. I&rsquo;m talking about the laserdisc version of the series and films - basically, the best version until the remastered Blu-rays released in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/47614aa20851d0a530da92efc229e4241661367270_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 480px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first room of the exhibition was a wall of just clear files from <b><i>Evangelion</i></b> history. Sadly, the idea of a promotional clear file for anime is a relatively new concept, so they&rsquo;re all based on visuals from the <b><i>Rebuild</i></b> film series. Still though, there are a lot there and likely the majority that was released.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Past the wall of clear files was an actual life-sized moving Unit 01 head that went berserk during its loop, and surprisingly, this was only the first moving Evangelion head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/c6791b3c2d8fce8658e698be98da676d1661367317_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 455px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/1dd684e05c2ee60a07a93fd00b3e3b8a1661367337_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 395px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/c4ac19fe7941f6f8a9c7c1406966d5ea1661367454_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 480px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/3584b774288af44d5456fb9c05ee9f781661367529_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 480px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a corridor before the main expo hall, the wall was lined with miscellaneous figures from both the retro Eva era to the newest figures. Just to add that spice of authenticity, there were UFO catcher machines set up holding goods that presumably were only available through those arcade games. As you can see from the AT Field &ldquo;No Touching&rdquo; sign, they were, unfortunately, not able to be played.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/2e9d4356bcadb514d6309676f617d07c1661367684_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 424px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/50fa975a591785189e8561bdf38ed42f1661370878_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 418px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above Unit 01 was guarding the huge expo hall. On the left was another, quite large figure of the same Eva for scale.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><b>The Wonders of Evangelion&rsquo;s Merchandising History</b></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/76bbf8ca1a725ce52b53c0a7bf73cbb01661370940_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 423px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I strolled by the likely very expensive Unit 01 figure, the <i>Evangelion Crossing Expo </i>opened up and was awash by all the merchandise on display. I was told there were over 4,000 items and it looked like it, with each display crammed full of Eva goods. I knew the series had been thrust into many different areas, including disaster management and, as you can see in the image above, a car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/9b11e57e06a46de4a8bdfbae08161a371661370968_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 402px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/fa0ec08f730ae8a0a4aa760a33794f2c1661370992_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 412px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/a37357cfe3f4654477fac58aebca961a1661371016_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 392px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/f5b7ab8df30a70ec638f36cb4f1269841661371041_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 386px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not wanting to be limited to the floor space, the designer for the exhibition opted to use the roof as well, showcasing a bunch of collaboration visuals in hexagons hanging from the ceiling. This included one of my favorites, the Schick collaboration with a smiling Gendo and weirdly red-faced and happy <b><i>Rebuild</i></b> girls. Why are they so happy? Is Gendo now super attractive after saving? Have they saved their legs for the first time? It&rsquo;s odd!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/3d2dd8e06514e1554db0c1cc6403b9961661371082_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 561px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/1310be356e59efe536b88c412220d5e11661371109_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 450px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/c2fa3eaa90605fb4085b597ff8d9a45a1661371134_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 365px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collectables aren&rsquo;t uncommon for anime goods, but for <b><i>Evangelion</i></b>, which now spans four different decades, there are some retro campaigns including the above card collection from a magazine. These days cards for <b><i>Digimon</i></b> or <b><i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i></b> are still given out at events and sometimes in magazines, but you&rsquo;re more likely to get a clear file with a printed anime magazine rather than just cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2022/08/23/report-celebrating-digimons-25-year-history-at-the-digital-monster-art-museum\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">REPORT: Celebrating Digimon&#39;s 25-Year History at the Digital Monster Art Museum</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then were the coins. <b><i>Evangelion</i></b> is by far one of the biggest anime franchises in Japan and is as close to a heritage series as <b><i>Gundam</i></b> or any film by Hayao Miyazaki. This is why the Japanese government through the Japan Mint printed not one set of coins, but the second set in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/b7bb471e39fb21d1d317841f362ff1d31661371198_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 363px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/e87524c825587bb3c6cd747965ad74ba1661371234_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 407px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/bb6ff49bb6007bf31c7058ee90edd1291661371267_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of magazines, being able to see original copies of Newsweek with the original designs of Rei and Shinji was a fantastic look into the past. The E-Mono magazine by Newtype, which was published in 1997, is like the <i>Evangelion Crossing Expo</i> but in book form, with information on merch, promotions and just random information on the franchise up until 1997. I&rsquo;d love to read it, if it wasn&rsquo;t behind a bunch of glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/3ef7f1c6e29eb632ffc199252bcadc321661371294_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 480px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/0d971e3d579b2a29129f8c98f7bdc2ee1661371323_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 429px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As previously mentioned, <b><i>Evangelion</i></b> is one of the only anime series that I can find that has a line&nbsp;of disaster-related goods.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top collaboration is the NERV Disaster Prevention App which is a must-have for anyone in Japan. What started as a fan project in the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 has evolved to be a crucial source of information for residents and tourists on current weather as well as impending or currently occurring disasters. The application tracks earthquakes in real-time to warn you at your location how badly they&rsquo;ll affect you. The app has personally helped me in preparing my family for more intense quakes that have occurred while living in Japan. The company and NERV branding have official permission from khara to run and was cross promoted during the theatrical screenings of <b><i>Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0: Thrice Upon a Time</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the image under the NERV app is an officially sanctioned Japan Defense Force ration kit that can be used in case of an earthquake or disaster. As someone who actually has this box and hopefully never has to use it, the meals in the units are probably still okay to eat if they weren&rsquo;t behind glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Evangelion Crossing Expo\" src=\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/5b1b95338c8932610f8e1ddb4654b0901661371439_main.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most intriguing things in the exhibition with the above DVDs of an Asuka cosplayer making a travel program. The cosplayer in question is a talento named Sakura-Saki Inagaki who was part of the <b><i>Rokemitsu</i></b> variety program that traveled around Japan showcasing various wonders while completing various tasks in a kind of <b><i>Amazing Race</i></b>-styled setup, and, according to the DVD in the above picture, went to Italy to do the same thing.

It was interesting how they were gendered with the female room being pink and full of plush dolls, while the male room had the guitar, sexier figures (mostly of Asuka) and more video games. I&rsquo;d hazard a guess that if an <em><strong>Evangelion</strong></em> fan was to deck out a room in just <b><i>Evangelion</i></b> gear, it&rsquo;d be a mix of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also love the subtle touch of a <em>Shin Godzilla</em> and <i>Ultraman</i> figure in the guy&rsquo;s room.

What makes this character's likeness so memorable?","date_created":"2022-11-12","author":"Cordell McWilliams","tags":"one punchman, saitama","body_content":"One-Punch Man's Saitama is a character that no one can mistake. His overall look and specific character design is iconic at this point. There are several factors that go into this, but the most important are undoubtedly his baldness and fluctuating cartoonish and realistic depictions. This certainly warrants digging deeper into. Right from the beginning, the first thing one notices when looking at Saitama is his striking baldness despite his young age. As part of his superhero origin story, he did what amounted to basic calisthenic strength training every day for three years (coupled with turning his air conditioning off in the summers and his heater off in the winters). For some reason, this resulted in him losing all of his hair. Perhaps his hair simply could not withstand the growing might of his awesome power. His baldness is referenced throughout the anime and made into a joke, making the name Saitama synonymous with baldness. He would not be the same character without this key physical feature.Perhaps the most interesting physical attribute Saitama possesses, however, is his propensity to change from a dopey cartoonish version of himself to a much more intense and realistic version. The anime does not explain these changes, and the other characters never seem to notice or acknowledge them. This has led many to believe one of two ways of thinking.On the one hand, it could be a way of showing the audience when something serious is happening versus something silly. When Saitama is feeling jaded and getting knocked around by an infinitely inferior opponent, he will stare ahead blankly without much detail on his face. This shows that the audience is not meant to be particularly invested in any kind of stakes going on in the moment. Viewers are invited to feel as jaded as Saitama, with the added bonus of being able to appreciate the humor.On the other hand, when Saitama is drawn as highly detailed and realistic, this essentially acts as a cue to the audience to sit up and pay attention. This look is typically associated with him performing godlike feats of strength in a menacing or heroic fashion, or when he actually feels something. Audiences see this in his dream sequence of fighting the Subterranean King’s forces, as well as when he first fought Crablante before gaining his ultimate power. Another interpretation is that, when he is cartoonish, viewers are seeing Saitama the way he views himself. His demeanor is plain and flat, so that is what is displayed. However, when he is detailed, audiences see him in the way that the world perceives him. A good example of this would be when Suiryu is on the brink of death and Saitama slowly walks into frame to save him. In moments like these, the anime portrays him as a heroic savior, displaying him in an artistically flattering manner.These features combined make for an unforgettable protagonist. Even the most casual of anime viewers could pick Saitama out of a lineup. Now, it's easier to understand why.","url":"https://www.cbr.com/one-punch-man-saitama-unique-character-design/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/saitama-delivering-a-punch.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

Pokémon fans across the globe have reacted to Ash's huge accomplishment, which took the iconic trainer over 25 years. In the grand finale of Ultimate Journeys, Ash became the World Champion after defeating Leon in the Masters Eight Tournament of the Pokémon World Coronation Series. The longtime protagonist's recent feat has proven that the boy from Pallet Town's journey with his companion Pikachu has come a long way since the anime premiered in 1997. @FireType_Tep shared a one-minute clip of the heated battle between Ash and Leon during Episode 132, \"The Finals IV: Partner\" of Ultimate Journeys. Many replied to the tweet with praise for the episode's animation. Additionally, one user pointed out Leon forgot to put his cap backward, which caused his defeat. @ThePokeRaf also shared a clip of Leon handing the trophy over to Ash, with the crowd roaring in applause. Many people have supported Ash over the course of his journey to the top. @MrCorviknight posted pictures of those who helped him along the way, including Misty, Brock, Professor Oak and May. In addition to the anime's countless characters, some fans have supported Ash since he first left Pallet Town. @Games23_ called this anticipated occasion a \"special, legendary, historic day.\" @RewindStraight considers the Ash vs. Leon World Championship battle a \"top 3 Pokémon battle at the very least.\" Another memorable battle in the anime's history includes Ash vs. Gladion at the Alolan region's Manalo Conference, which granted the protagonist his first ever Pokémon League Champion title. Ash's battle against Professor Kukui at the Manalo Conference also went down in history. In addition to fans, Sarah Natochenny, the English dub voice actor for Ash, reacted to the trainer becoming the World Champion. At 19 years old, Natochenny replaced Veronica Taylor, starting with the anime's ninth season in 2006. Many screens in Tokyo's Shibuya ward streamed Ash's victory to commemorate the occasion. Some fans theorized the ending was near for Ultimate Journeys after titles for episodes 133, 134 and 135 leaked online. \"Episode 135 is allegedly named \"Pokémon, I'm Glad I Chose You!,\" which some believe references the first episode of the original anime titled, \"Pokémon - I Choose You!\" The first 12 episodes of Pokémon Ultimate Journeys: The Series is streaming now on Netflix in the United States.

VERSUS will release on Nov. 26. One-Punch Man was originally a self-published webcomic released in 2009. In 2010, ONE announced that the series would be on hiatus, and during that time, it was read by Eyeshield 21's Yusuke Murata, who immediately knew that he wanted to work with the writer. The two of them produced two one-shots together before remaking One-Punch Man, which the Tonari no Young Jump website serialized in 2012. The story follows a man who has a powerful and deadly punch that can knock out his opponents in one swing.\nAfter One-Punch Man, ONE's next major work was Mob Psycho 100 which ran from 2012 to 2017. Written and illustrated by ONE, the series follows a rather unassuming and plain-looking boy named Mob who is secretly a powerful psychic. Hoping to learn to control his abilities, he trains under a con-man named Reigen Arataka.

Based on the Tensura light novel series written by Fuse and illustrated by Mitz Vah, the story, in standard isekai fashion, starts with an ordinary young adult dying in a tragic accident and getting reborn into a fantasy world with a brand-new body and special abilities. Season 3 currently does not have a projected release window. Although the Tensura franchise began as a light novel series, Eight Bit's popular anime adaptation specifically follows the manga version of the story, which is written by Fuse and illustrated by Taiki Kawakami. Kodansha began serializing the comic in its Monthly Shonen Sirius magazine in 2015. The story revolves around a 37-year-old man named Satoru Mikami who lives a mundane, lonely, and ultimately unsatisfying life. One day, he is murdered by a robber and reborn as a blue slime monster in a sword-and-sorcery fantasy world. After befriending the 'Storm Dragon\" Veldora, Mikami receives the name \"Rimiru Tempest\" and a new human form. After this fortunate turn of events, Rimiru sets forth to create a new nation where his new world's inhabitants can live in peace, joy and comfort. In addition to the upcoming third season, Eight Bit is also wrapping up the franchise's first feature-length movie. An early film screening was recently held in Japan immediately before the Season 3 announcement. This film, titled That Time I Got Reincarnated As a Slime: Scarlet Bond, is directed by Yasuhito Kikuchi with an original story written by Tensura's creator, Fuse. The plot revolves around a country called Raja, a small nation West of Tempest that is the origin of a mysterious power known only as \"Queen.\" As this power continues to mystify the world's inhabitants, Rimiru Tempest meets an Ogre named Hiiro, one of the last remaining survivors of his race. The film debuts in Japan on Nov. 25. Crunchyroll will distribute the film theatrically in every major global territory except Asia in early 2023. That Time I Got Reincarnated As a Slime is available to stream on Crunchyroll. The Tensura light novels are available in English from Yen Press, while Kawakami's manga adaptation is available in English from Kodansha US.","url":"https://www.cbr.com/the-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-third-season/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Slimeboy.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

To make it more life-like, Tom added short, textured fur. In the short video, which has amassed over a million views, Pochita moves his head around, curious about his surroundings while his tail wags around. To make it extra cute, Pochita shifts his paws around, exactly like a dog would. Fans fawned over Pochita, with many comparing it to a kiwi as they're both approximately the same shape. The fan's Pochita edit received over 120,000 likes and over 20,000 retweets since its posting on Nov. 18. As thanks, Tom showed behind-the-scenes footage of the production process, such as Pochita without his fur. This different angle showcased his back and even included an angry Pochita, which the artist ultimately rejected in favor of the more huggable version. While it will likely be some time before Chainsaw Man receives a live-action adaptation, fans have already come up with creative edits and cosplays. One cosplayer uploaded an Aki cosplay on Douyin that transformed a simple cosplay into a jaw-dropping CG world that transported the cosplayer straight into the Chainsaw Man world. Another fan made the chainsaws on their arms, and head move through ingenious design and engineering. Tatsuki Fujimoto began working on Chainsaw Man shortly after Fire Punch. As a film buff, Fujimoto's inspiration came from the numerous works that he watched. One example was the pivotal battle in Part 1 of the manga found inspiration from the anime film trilogy Kizumonogatari. Chainsaw Man received an anime adaptation produced by MAPPA. The mangaka is heavily involved in the anime, having seen the scripts and storyboards. To faithfully adapt the manga, MAPPA promised not to censor the violence, gore and sexual elements. The first part of the manga found its home in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 2018 to 2020 before taking a hiatus. Part 1 introduces the protagonist Denji, a young man living in poverty whose life changes after his best friend, the chainsaw devil dog Pochita, brings him back to life. Pochita's sacrifice gives him the ability to turn into a Devil called Chainsaw Man with the pull of a cord in his chest. This power makes him an unpredictable yet invaluable part of the Public Safety Devil Hunters, a group of Devil Hunters dedicated to fighting Devils. Part 2 began in Shōnen Jump, starting in July 2022, with new characters and a new threat. Airing every Tuesday, Chainsaw Man is available to watch on Crunchyroll and Hulu. The manga is available to read on Viz Media and Manga Plus and is updated every Tuesday.","url":"https://www.cbr.com/chainsaw-man-pochita-dangerously-cute-pixar-character/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chainsaw-man-pochita-3d-fan-edit.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

Here's the cultural significance behind this and what it's led to.","date_created":"2022-11-19","author":"Marc York","tags":"anime, gundam, mobile suit gundam, mobile suit gundam: the witch from mercury","body_content":"Suletta Mercury, the protagonist of The Witch From Mercury, has been called a lot of things. In the anime, she's been accused of being an idiot, a witch, and a sex-crazed pervert (色ボケ, iroboke). Outside of the Gundam series, she's been called a clone, a cinnamon bun, and, oddly enough, a Tanuki (たぬき).\r\n\r\nFans of the show, especially Japanese fans, have taken to referring to Suletta as Mercury Tanuki (水星たぬき, Suisei Tanuki) or Tanuki-chan (たぬきちゃん). Keeping in line with this, there are all sorts of fan art depicting the girl as an anthropomorphized raccoon dog. As for the reasoning behind all this, it's a cultural thing. In Japan, there is a typical facial expression known as the tanuki gao (たぬき顔). People with this kind of face are said to have an expression of feigned ignorance. It's a silly face that makes them look like a fool. Naturally, it also makes them look vaguely similar to the Japanese raccoon dog.\r\n\r\nSuletta has been likened to a tanuki because of her facial features. Tanuki gao often describes women with rounder faces and more childish features. Suletta also shares a lot of other features that liken her to a tanuki, including droopy eyes, dark skin, and big eyebrows. This face combined with her foolish demeanor make her seem all too much like a tanuki. Many Japanese fans have taken it upon themselves to complete Suletta's look. She'll often be given tanuki ears, a tail, or both in fan art. Some fans will tackle this topic from the other end of the spectrum and draw a Tanuki with Suletta's features. Some even joke that a tanuki is her original form. Either way, the result usually comes out looking cute and huggable. It's worth noting that there's a parallel to the tanuki gao called the kitsune gao (きつね顔, lit. \"fox face\"). In contrast to the tanuki, kitsune are known for their narrower faces, close-set eyes, thin eyebrows, and sharper features in general. These features are considered conventionally attractive and are ascribed to foxes who have taken the form of a human female. Fox-faced could be used to describe Suletta's fiancé Miorine Rembran. Not only does she have these sharp features, but she also has the sharp wit commonly associated with a fox. As such, a lot of fan art of Suletta as a tanuki will also feature Mio as a kitsune. This contrast may have been a conscious choice by the character designer.\r\n\r\nIn an case, Suletta will likely continue to be called a tanuki until well after her series ends. Such is the nature of both Japanese culture and meme culture, especially Gundam meme culture. Anybody looking to draw Suletta fan art should feel free to give her as many tanuki features as they please.","url":"https://www.cbr.com/the-witch-from-mercury-why-suletta-tanuki/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sulleta-witch-from-mercury.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

Uta isn't the first One Piece character Glory Lamothe has brought to life; their TikTok also features several Nico Robin cosplays as well as costumes for Boa Hancock and Yamato. Uta made her debut in One Piece's story in the franchise's latest film, One Piece Film: Red. The movie sees Monkey D. Luffy and the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates sail to the Island of Music. There, they encounter the pop star, who is revealed to be a childhood friend of Luffy's and the estranged daughter of Red-Haired Shanks. While Uta desires to combat suffering and pain with her beautiful music, her actual plan greatly resembles the goals of none other than Obito and Madara Uchiha from Naruto. Film Red premiered in Japan in August and in most Western markets in November. With an ever-growing box office that has already surpassed 18 billion yen (approximately $180 million), the title is undoubtedly the most profitable One Piece movie so far. More importantly, Film Red currently stands as Japan's highest-grossing film in 2022 and is one of the country's top ten highest-earning movies of all time, alongside anime classics like Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle and Ponyo. The iconic One Piece manga by Eiichiro Oda first appeared in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1997. The story follows the young pirate captain Luffy, who dreams of becoming the next King of the Pirates, as he and his crew journey across the Grand Line in search of the titular treasure. Across the manga's over 1,000 chapters, Oda has introduced readers to a plethora of crazy and colorful characters, and Uta isn't the only one who has inspired incredible cosplay. Notably, a couple of cosplays recently brought fan-favorite characters Princess Vivi and Trafalgar D. Water Law, aka The Surgeon of Death, to life in stunning detail. One Piece fans have more to be excited about than the release of Film Red and incredible cosplays. Several new products based on the pirate series have been released, including Lush's line of One Piece bath bombs and VANS' One Piece apparel collection.\r\n\r\nOne Piece Film: Red is in theaters now.","url":"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-cosplayer-wows-homemade-uta-jacket/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/One-Piece-Film-Red-Uta.jpeg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

The dynamic animation portrayed an intense fight, keeping audiences on their toes as each technique surpassed the previous and the stakes continued to climb with each passing second due to the overwhelming power of Yamamoto’s Bankai slowly destroying the Soul Society. However, another factor was being displayed within the battle itself -- the history and emotions of Yhwach. Whilst the person Yamamoto was actually fighting was the Sternritter “Y”, Royd Lloyd; his power, 'The Yourself', replicated Yhwach, down to his memories, feelings, power and most importantly, motivations. For all intents and purposes, the internal dialogue witnessed was a literal exact replica of Yhwach and how he would have behaved, thought, and felt. With this information taken into account, the battle was not only a marvelous spectacle of the most powerful characters engaging in world-breaking combat, it offered an in-depth exploration as to what Yhwach is doing, why his relationship with Yamamoto is laced with vengeful hatred, and also helped audiences connect with a character who has only just joined the vast cast of Bleach. There are multiple methods of storytelling when it comes to revealing the backstory of a character. Exposition dumps are considered one of the less narrative intriguing manners in which to do so, with the practice of \"show don't tell\" being preferred by a majority of fans. The Bleach anime decided to make use of the latter. Up to this point, it was known that Yhwach and the Quincy warred with Soul Reapers many years prior, but by having the imagery flashback to his and Yamamoto’s previous battle added a level of urgency and connection to the present conflict, which the audiences are currently engaged in. This window into the past, even if only in brief flickers of visual images, helped transform Yhwach from a newly appearing super-powered villain, which can be considered lazy writing at times, into a crucial element in Bleach's world-building. By depicting a connection through visual storytelling instead of repeatedly stating in a monologue or narrator dialogue that Yhwach was part of the world long ago with a vendetta against the Soul Society, it made the conflict feel far more personal and predestined. The subtle moments of internal dialogue between the two characters then carries far more weight as they consider the growth and power of their opponent. Understanding the history of an antagonist certainly helps audiences connect to their arc, but Bleach went a step further during this fight scene. The Soul Reapers have been heroic, but flawed, figures of Bleach since the Soul Society Arc. While many are good-natured, there has always been a shadow of impurity foreshadowed in their past. They are complex but still the heroes of the story, alongside Ichigo Kurosaki. The Wandenreich arrived and began their slaughter, immediately being considered the monstrous invaders. Yet, the nuance of their position was given some light through the flashback imagery and the use of Yamamoto’s Bankai power, Zanka no Tachi, Minami: Kaka Jumanokushi Daisojin -- Power of the South -- to raise the dead. Yamamoto’s tormenting of Yhwach through utilizing the Quincy’s dead comrades from a thousand-years prior was nothing short of being rage filled and sadistic. Yamamoto showed to not only have the upper hand throughout the fight, but was practically dominating Yhwach to the point of where he could patiently watch as Yhwach was overrun by corpses of his dead friends. This act made Yhwach appear vulnerable and allowed audiences to sympathize with him far more easily. Even as an antagonist, being clawed and grappled by the bone-burnt remains of former friends is an unparalleled torment. Having an antagonist that is as compelling as the protagonist is important to any story. One fault often attributed to Sosuke Aizen was the lack of revealed motives. He wanted power, he wanted to destroy the Soul King, but how he came to be the man he was had never truly been explored. When compared to a character like Madara Uchiha from Naruto, there is a stark difference in personal development in the path that led to their position as an antagonist. An emotional motivation that audiences can relate to is a true and tested formula to creating a sympathetic villain that audiences can connect to on the same level as the protagonist. Through a single episode, peppered into an unyielding fight scene, Bleach was able to not only bring a new and unknown character to life through expertly placed imagery, but also balance the scales of morality by offering an understandable, yet still despicable, motivation for Yhwach. Revenge is a well-known and well-used motivating factor in many villains throughout the history of storytelling, and it is likely there is more to Yhwach than simple vengeance. After this episode, audiences will be far more invested into the developing arc of the series final antagonist.","url":"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-thousand-year-war-anime-adds-emotional-depth-yhwach/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Yhwach-screaming-against-Yamamoto-Bleach.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

She can be sweet and caring, but she can also be possessive and even destructive in a lot of very unhealthy ways. If she were to have her way, she would have been a danger to herself and everyone she cared about.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, Uta isn't a yandere in the romantic sense. She's more like a shock yandere, one who displays romantic yandere traits towards someone they care about but has motivations besides love. In Uta's case, her treatment of her worldwide audience was the result of past trauma and isolation, but there will be time to cover that later. For now, here's a look at some of the things she did in the movie and how they might make her a yandere. At first, it was hard to tell that Uta had darker intentions than even she realized. She came off as a cheery and benevolent songstress hoping only to please her fans and anyone else listening to her concert. She might have had a few emotional hangups about the state of the world, but nothing that would stop her from trying to bring everybody joy. However, as the movie progressed, the depth of her troubled mindset became far more apparent.\r\n\r\nUta's real plan was much worse than anyone realized, even Uta Herself. Her concert was actually just an illusion created with her Sing-Sing Fruit powers. Her plan after putting everyone in the dream world where nothing could go wrong was to eat the aptly named wake-shrooms until she died from exhaustion. Once this happened, her dream world would be cut off from reality and everyone's souls would remain there forever. This is to say nothing of her justification for essentially killing herself and all her listeners. Her dedication to this cause was harmful to herself and others. Uta attacked anyone who tried to stop her concert. This included not just pirates like Luffy, but also the Navy, a Celestial Dragon, and even audience members who wanted to leave. She assumed that she could give them whatever they wanted, including freedom from suffering, but many of them just wanted to go home. Instead of releasing them, she doubled down and tried to make things more fun. This choice shows just how immature and close-minded, and overprotective she was being on the matter.\r\n\r\nAs Uta continued to lose control of the situation, she resorted to unleashing the demonic entity, Tot Musica. Besides how hypocritical this was to her cause to end suffering, it revealed a darker and scarier side to her than anything she'd shown before. By this point, she resembled a yandere in words, actions, and appearance. In fairness, it's not as though Uta didn't have her reasons for acting out like this. As a child, she was seemingly abandoned by Shanks on an island he'd supposedly plundered. She spent the next 10 years cut off from the outside world save for a man named Gordon. She'd only had two more years of contact with the outside world through Video Transponder Snails. Even then, it was mostly her fans reinforcing her views that she was some sort of savior from the suffering pirates cause. That kind of isolation isn't good for anyone's mental health. It's also worth noting the influence of the wake-shrooms Uta was eating throughout the movie. Symptoms of eating these mushrooms include irrational and aggressive behavior. Uta had been eating wake-shrooms since before the concert started, so most of her yandere moments in the movie can be attributed to them; whatever negative impulses she had were probably magnified to the point where she felt the need to act on them.\r\n\r\nNone of this justifies Uta's yandere actions. but it does explain how she ended up as she did. The combination of a traumatic past, a sheltered life, and the wake-shrooms clouding her judgment probably led her to make all sorts of misguided conclusions and poor decisions. However, whether she can still be empathized with after threatening to trap roughly 70% of the world's population in a dream world is highly debatable. Whatever her reasons, she could definitely be called a yandere in this movie. At the very least, she went far out of her way to make up for her mistakes. She sang one last beautiful song to wake everyone up before giving in to her exhaustion. In the end, all she ever wanted was for everyone to be happy.\r\n\r\nDespite her flaws, Uta remained a fairly charming and well-meaning character throughout One Piece Film: Red. She displayed some bad yandere traits, but they were at least understandable enough to keep her from becoming unrelatable. She was also willing to learn from her mistakes and make up for them, even at the cost of her well-being. If she is a yandere, she's on the better end of the spectrum.","url":"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-film-red-uta-yandere-traits/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/One-Piece-Uta-smiling-Tot-Musica.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

Sosuke Aizen and Ginjo Kugo may have fallen, but now the mighty Wandenreich, the Quincy empire, is ready to get revenge and wipe out all the Soul Reapers. They have even more powers than Uryu Ishida ever did, including Voll Stern Dich.\r\n\r\nBleach fans got a taste of Quincy powers through Uryu Ishida, but the mighty Sternritter have unique powers, most of which are their own version of shikai or bankai. By now, just five episodes into the new Bleach arc, fans have seen what a handful of Sternritter can do, and there are many more on the way. These are the deadly Quincy powers that might spell the Soul Reapers' doom. The first Sternritter to appear, the bloodthirsty Quilge Opie, is known as Sternritter J for a good reason. Quilge was already powerful in his Hueco Mundo battle with his basic spirit weapons and absorption of nearby spirit energy, but he had one more trick up his sleeve. In recent episodes, Quilge used his unique ability, The Jail, to trap Ichigo inside a sphere of hardened spirit energy. The Jail doesn't harm its occupant, but it's very tough -- not even Ichigo's bankai and Getsuga Tensho blasts can break it. Quilge's main goal is to keep Ichigo occupied so he cannot aid the Soul Reapers, and The Jail is the ideal ability for that mission. It's unknown how, when or even if Ichigo will break free of The Jail in time to aid the Soul Reapers in the Soul Society. Sternritter F, As Nodt, recently revealed his power called The Fear. It takes the form of glowing, dart-like Quincy arrows that deal not just physical damage but also a psychic attack. As Nodt's arrows inflict intense terror on their targets, and the mental agony might finish them off in some cases. As Nodt can massacre unseated Soul Reapers with his arrows, and against a stronger foe like Captain Byakuya Kuchiki, his fear aura and psychological warfare techniques are still somewhat potent. As Nodt reawakened Byakuya's dormant fear of death and violence, even creating illusions of a rotted Rukia Kuchiki and countless flies swarming over Byakuya's body. It was enough to rattle Byakuya and goad him into a reckless attack that As Nodt easily countered with a stolen bankai. Sternritter O, Driscoll Berci, is a huge man who thrives on slaughter. As he explained to Lieutenant Shuhei Hisagi, Driscoll charges up The Overkill by slaughtering other people or animals, whether they were friends or foes. The Overkill has no limits, and with 100 kills, Driscoll had sufficient power to finish off Lieutenant Chojiro Sasakibe with one strike. Then Driscoll killed another 100 Soul Reapers during the main Quincy invasion, and he nearly killed Shuhei until Yamamoto himself arrived to defeat Driscoll once and for all. The Overkill's rampage is over, but Driscoll claimed just over 200 victims alone with that power, showing how truly terrifying and powerful the Sternritter are. The Thousand-Year Blood War arc hinted at the abilities of several other Sternritter, though their true capabilities have not yet been shown. One example is the reckless female Sternritter E, Bambietta Basterbine, who can turn any object into an explosive device to blast away her foes. Fans of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure will be reminded of Yoshikage Kira's Stand Killer Queen, which has similar abilities. Elsewhere, Sternritter I, Cang Du, hardened his skin not with Blut Vene but with his ability The Iron, capable of blocking any attack whatsoever. This makes Cang Du Bleach's own Eijiro Kirishima. The mohawk-wearing Quincy Bazz-B is Sternritter H, using his ability The Heat to shoot flame-based attacks from his bare fingers. He used just one finger's worth of The Heat to inflict a serious injury on Lieutenant Izuru Kira, and Bazz-B is just getting warmed up. Bleach fans can only imagine what Bazz-B can do with two or more fingers when using The Heat. Finally, fans got a hint of Sternritter L's ability, called The Love. Sternritter L, PePe Waccabrada, can use The Love to control other people. With that power, PePe forced Jidanbo the gate guardian to attack defenseless Soul Reaper staff, wreaking havoc. Akon couldn't believe his eyes when Jidanbo stormed the place, possessed by his unnatural love for Sternritter L.","url":"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-thousand-year-blood-war-wandenreich-quilge-opie-as-nodt-powers-explained/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Bleach-Wandenreich.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

This guide makes it simple for newcomers.","date_created":"2022-11-11","author":"Faiyaz Chowdhury","tags":"anime, fate, fate/stay night","body_content":"The Fate franchise exploded onto the anime scene in the last decade after Ufotable's adaptation of Gen Urobuchi and Takeshi Takeuchi's light novel, Fate/Zero in 2011. Not long after that, the Fate anime series experienced an enormous boom that spawned many, many sequels and multiple spinoffs. However, due to this very phenomenon, the Fate series has become one that is overwhelming for newcomers. Luckily, there is a determined watch order for the Fate series. The Fate series can be tricky to begin to navigate without any prior information; however, with the right information it's actually more straightforward than it may seem -- as this guide will demonstrate. The biggest source of confusion in the series -- as there are many confusing things within the franchise -- mainly stems from its first installment being a terrible adaptation. However, there's more than one method for newcomers to dive into this immensely popular series. Let's dive into how to watch the Fate series, including the anime, shows and visual novel. The Fate/stay night anime is an adaptation of the visual novel of the same name. The visual novel consists of three alternative story routes called the \"Fate,\" \"Unlimited Blade Works\" and \"Heaven's Feel\" route, with the narrative intent being to play each route in the given order. When Studio Deen took up the task to adapt the visual novel in 2006, the studio wasn't sure if there would be a follow-up sequel, so instead of adapting the Fate route alone, it instead decided to create a Frankenstein's monster of an anime that took bits and pieces from the other routes. Due to this, as well as other reasons, the resulting anime was of subpar quality. The Fate series eventually gained redemption when Ufotable took over the rights and released Fate/Zero, which immediately garnered critical acclaim. Studio Deen also adapted the Unlimited Blade Works route into a movie, which fortunately got remade by Ufotable in 2014 as a TV series of the same name. Ufotable then followed this up with a trilogy of movies covering the Heaven's Feel route, the third of which was released in 2020.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, since Ufotable -- as of yet -- has not remade Studio Deen's terrible adaptation of the Fate route, anime-only fans are left with the single option of powering through the 2006 adaptation in order to experience its story. Instead, after watching the 2006 version, the next series in the Fate watch order would be 2014's Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, followed by the Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel trilogy. The brilliant Fate/Zero series, which is a prequel to the events of Fate/stay night, can be watched immediately after the 2006 adaptation, although it's best advised to watch up until Heaven's Feel II beforehand in order to avoid any spoilers. Lastly, it's recommended to watch Fate/Grand Order - Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia after Heaven's Feel III, and the remaining Grand Order films afterwards.\r\n\r\nUsing this Fate watch order method allows you to skip Studio Deen's adaptation altogether and instead start with the Fate/Zero series. Although this watch order is sure to spoil certain events from the Fate/stay night anime, it ensures fans are immediately hooked into the series instead of having to drudge through the 2006 anime, which may leave a bad taste in one's mouth. The Fate/Zero series provides enough lore and context for Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works to make sense without having to watch the Fate route. This watch order, however, is not the most advisable for new fans as it leads to a less content-rich experience. It is ideal, though, for those who prefer for the series to start in high gear, and are unwilling to sit through a mediocre adaptation or a lengthy visual novel. However, for those ready to consume the Fate franchise in its intended order, the next method is currently the best one possible, and it involves more than just watching the anime series. This method is the simplest: begin your Fate journey with the visual novel wherein the Fate route is available, unadulterated. After playing the Fate route, fans can then play the remaining two routes, or they can jump into the Unlimited Blade Work anime series and Heaven's Feel movies, before concluding the main series with Fate/Zero. After that, they can jump around and watch as many of the optional Fate spinoffs as they want in any order desired.\r\n\r\nThis method ensures viewers get the definitive experience without having to put up with any less than stellar adaptations. The visual novel itself, although devoid of the great animation that defines Ufotable's adaptations, is miles better than the 2006 anime, and is also very good in its own right as far as visual novels are concerned.","url":"https://www.cbr.com/fate-series-quick-guide-watching-anime/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fate-Stay-Night-1.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

These works have taken not only Japan but much of the globe by storm, being massive successes both critically and commercially. However, not everyone enjoys certain aspects of the stories that tend to pervade shonen franchises. For example, as many of them are incredibly long, it means their anime adaptations often feature unsatisfying filler content or low-quality animation. Meanwhile, some series dip into immature fanservice for the sake of comedy, or else try too hard to be edgy, only to come across as eye-rollingly self-serious and grimdark. Such problems, among others, are all present to some degree in the below titles. In the twilight years of the Bakumatsu period, an infamous assassin known as Hitokiri Battousai -- the sword-drawing manslayer -- suddenly vanished, although the name very much lives on. A decade later, a cheerful wandering samurai named Himura Kenshin stumbles across Kamiya Kaoru, a young woman doing her best to run her family’s dojo. After saving her from a murderer pretending to be the Hitokiri Battousai, Kenshin is revealed to be the real assassin, sworn now only to use his sword to protect. Kaoru allows the pacifist samurai to stay at her dojo, where numerous friends, enemies and adventures inevitably find him. Based on a 1994-1999 Shonen Jump manga, the Rurouni Kenshin televised series was the first exposure to anime for many Western fans who began watching around that time. It also transcended the demographic in many ways, with the title having a broad appeal across genders and age groups. Nonetheless, the show is fraught with issues, with dramatic tonal shifts depending on the story arc, slow pacing due to a large amount of filler content, and a predictable villain-of-the-week storyline throughout much of its runtime. Season 3 in particular is frequently lambasted even by fans of the anime, who criticize the lack of realism, comparatively lackluster fight scenes and unsatisfying conclusion. Higurashi Kagome is a strong-willed and courageous girl who, on her 15th birthday, finds herself forcefully transported into a demon-infested feudal Japan. Unbeknownst to her, she is in possession of the Shikon Jewel -- a relic containing incredible power that demons greatly desire. When she is discovered by the half-demon Inuyasha, he dislikes her on sight, mistaking her for a priestess named Kikyo, but decides to help. Now, he and Kagome, the latter of whom turns out to be Kikyo’s reincarnation, set out on an epic journey to recover the shards of the Shikon Jewel after they were broken and scattered across the land, lest they fall into the wrong hands. Takahashi Rumiko’s works are beloved by many anime and manga fans, and perhaps none more so than Inuyasha. The anime, based on a 1996-2008 series published in Weekly Shonen Sunday, is often cited as being Takahashi’s best animated work. Even so, this does not mean the show is devoid of problems. Other than featuring the high amount of recap and filler content one might expect from any series over 150 episodes in length, bogging down the pacing considerably, one of its biggest issues is the formulaic and rather one-note characters. In particular, Kagome and Inuyasha’s overly tsundere relationship comes across as a foregone conclusion; however, their constant bickering, immature stubbornness and overbearing jealousy is far more annoying than romantic, leading to a frustrating viewing experience. Kyon is an average high school boy who meets a not-so-average classmate: a girl named Suzumiya Haruhi, who actively seeks to uncover the existence of supernatural entities such as psychics and time travelers. Kyon is reluctantly dragged into Haruhi’s schemes when she forms the SOS Brigade club to investigate such phenomena, which is soon joined by the seemingly more normal Nagato Yuki, Asahina Mikuru and Koizumi Itsuki. However, much like Haruhi, there is far more to these individuals than meets the eye, and Kyon’s life is quickly upended by the various secrets that could threaten the very world around them -- even if Haruhi herself is blissfully unaware of this fact.\n\nFirst published as a series of light novels in 2003 by Kadokawa Shoten’s teen male-oriented The Sneaker magazine, then adapted into a shonen manga in the pages of Shonen Ace, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is still best known for its anime adaptation, at least in the West, where it became a major cultural phenomenon. However, despite its undeniable popularity, the anime contains numerous pitfalls. It’s extremely dialogue and exposition-driven, doing far more in the way of telling than showing. Combined with the unrelenting over-sexualization of Mikuru and the titular character herself often being completely insufferable, this results in a show that’s patchy at best and unamusingly crude otherwise. In a world where humans live behind enormous concrete walls, constantly threatened by man-eating humanoid giants known as Titans, a brave few wage war against these terrifying enemies. Eren Yeager, who once witnessed his own mother die in front of his eyes at the hands of a Titan, joins the Survey Corps -- an elite military unit dedicated to fighting for humanity. Together with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and childhood friend Armin Arlert, they seek to eradicate the Titans once and for -- but political strife, numerous betrayals and buried secrets follow them, changing the course of their respective stories and challenging their worldviews amid relentless death and destruction.\n\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate just how popular the Attack on Titan franchise has grown over the years. First released in 2009 as a Bessatsu Shonen Magazine manga, its currently ongoing anime adaptation has gained legions of fans despite its many glaring flaws. While Attack on Titan presents itself as groundbreaking and adrenalizing, there is very little truly unique about the plot, and the explicit gore and violence come across as being more for shock value than anything else. Complete with uneven pacing -- particularly within the first season -- and underwhelming character development, Attack on Titan may appeal to the grimdark \"edgy\" crowd but lacks too much subtlety and depth to be genuinely good. Fushi is an immortal created by an otherworldly presence known only as the Beholder. First taking the form of a rock, then a dying wolf, and finally a lone, unnamed boy once he too perishes, Fushi travels throughout the land in search of meaning, learning along the way about what it truly means to be human and part of society. However, both Fushi’s existence and that of others are threatened by the Nokkers -- supernatural plant-like beings who seemingly seek only to kill. Full of both love and grief, Fushi’s journey leads him to forge connections and protect those who he comes to love, even when humanity itself sometimes proves to be manipulative or malevolent.\r\n\r\nInitially published as a manga in Weekly Shonen Magazine in 2016 and still ongoing, the likewise currently-airing anime of To Your Eternity has amassed quite a following, in large part thanks to its incredibly strong premiere and highly impactful themes. The main issue with the show is that the first season went on a downhill trajectory, starting off breathtakingly strongly but declining in its storytelling with each major story arc. To Your Eternity has enormous potential, but it frequently kneecaps itself by becoming formulaic and predictable with its characters (in particular, its character deaths). It also sometimes sacrifices proper character development for Fushi by focusing on far less poignant plot points or characters, which is what made the final \"Jananda Island\" arc of Season 1 so disappointingly weak.","url":"https://www.cbr.com/most-overrated-shounen-anime/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/attack-on-titan-haruhi-suzumiya-inuyasha.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

Oculus co-founder and self-avowed Sword Art Online super fan Palmer Luckey seems to have been enraptured by this idea -- not the incredibly advanced and entirely immersive virtual reality headset, but the machine that can kill people. In a Nov. 6 blog post commemorating the in-universe release date of Sword Art Online's eponymous and deadly game, Luckey claims to have created something akin to the series' NerveGear. He says that he's \"halfway to making a true NerveGear.\" The only issue is the \"half\" Luckey claims he's perfected is just the part that can kill the player. Luckey's take on the headset isn't quite the same as that of Sword Art Online creator Reki Kawahara. Where the headset in SAO's anime, manga, light novels and video games kills its user by frying their brain with an incredibly powerful microwave emitter, Luckey reportedly took a slightly more analog approach to player-killing. As he puts it, \"I used three of the explosive charge modules I usually use for a different project.\" That \"different project\" may have something to do with Luckey's military-contracted defense technology company, Anduril Industries, which he founded after leaving Oculus in 2017. That means that, assuming Luckey's blog post is sincere, any player unlucky enough to \"die in the game,\" as it were, would \"die in real life\" by taking three military-grade explosive charges straight to the head. It's not entirely clear whether or not Luckey is joking. He claims to have built the machine as a tribute to a series that changed his life. According to Luckey, Sword Art Online was a major boon for Oculus in its pre-Facebook days. He says, \"The popularity of [Sword Art Online] led to massive otaku enthusiasm for Oculus, especially in Japan, which quickly became our 2nd largest market.\" Luckey's supposed player-killing headset remains a work in progress and seemingly not intended for public use. It's also never been used as, in Luckey's words, \"I have not worked up the balls to actually use it myself.\" Luckey further explained the VR's current status, saying, \"At this point, it is just a piece of office art, a thought-provoking reminder of unexplored avenues in game design. It is also, as far as I know, the first non-fiction example of a VR device that can actually kill the user. It won't be the last.\"","url":"https://www.cbr.com/oculus-co-founder-palmer-luckey-deadly-vr-headset-sao/","thumbnail":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sword-Art-Online-Kiriko.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5","Publisher":"CBR"}

As such, this article will be updated over time with news, rumors, and analysis. Meanwhile, let’s delve down into what is known for certain.</em></p>\r\n<h2>Crunchyroll&#8217;s Kaguya-sama: Love is War -The First Kiss That Never Ends- English dub release date</h2>\r\n<p>As previously mentioned, the Kaguya-sama movie is coming to the USA in Feburary 2023. It&#8217;s currently unknown if the film will receive any international screenings in Canada, UK, or any other English-speaking countries.</p>\r\n<p>Presumably, Crunchyroll will produce the Kaguya-sama: Love is War -The First Kiss That Never Ends- English dub since the anime streaming company produced the English dubbed episodes for the third season.</p>\r\n<h2>The Kaguya-sama movie will be a short film</h2>\r\n<p>Based on the title, the Kaguya-sama: Love is War -The First Kiss That Never Ends- movie will adapt the 10-chapter Christmas-themed story arc of the same name, which means it’s a direct sequel to Kaguya-sama Season 3: Ultra Romantic rather than an anime original story.</p>\r\n<p>Considering that the average anime episode adapted 3 to 5 manga chapters it’s likely that the Kaguya-sama First Kiss movie runtime will be the equivalent of a relatively short film or a long OVA episode.</p>\r\n<h2>Kaguya-sama Season 4 is up next?</h2>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/kaguya-sama-love-is-war-season-4-release-date-kaguya-sama-wa-kokurasetai-tensai-tachi-no-renai-zunousen-season-4/\">Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 4 release date</a> hasn&#8217;t been announced yet. However, it&#8217;s likely that the ending or post-credits of the First Kiss movie will tease the next sequel.</p>\r\n<p>After all, the final scene of Kaguya-sama Season 3 Episode 13 seemed to contain a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/kaguya-sama-season-4-anime-teased-by-hidden-message-in-s3-episode-13-finale/\">secret message hidden in Kaguya’s eyes</a>.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"456\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kaguya-sama-Season-4-Eyes-Hint.jpg?resize=780%2C456&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kaguya-sama: Love Is War!

In 2021, they were also working on original anime like Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#8217;s Song, Netflix&#8217;s Vampire in the Garden, and an adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/ranking-of-kings-season-2-release-date-ousama-ranking-season-2-osama-ranking/\">Ranking of Kings (Ousama Ranking)</a> manga. In recent years, WIT Studio&#8217;s leaders have been quite open about preferring to develop their own original stories if they can although they&#8217;re still adapting manga and light novels.</p>\r\n<p>Coincidentally, WIT Studio announced in early March 2021 that they&#8217;re working on a Kickstarter-funded OAD for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnuQ_z-J5vE\">The Girl from the Other Side: Siuil, a Run</a> manga series.

Meanwhile, let’s delve down into what is known for certain.</em></p>\r\n<h2 id=\"mahoutsukai-no-yome-season-2-release-date-predictions\">Why we predicted the Mahoutsukai no Yome Season 2 release date was in 2023</h2>\r\n<p>As of the last update, Studio KAFKA, Twin Engine, Mag Garden, Shochiku, or any company related to the production of the anime has not officially confirmed the exact The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride Season 2 release date. However, the production of The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride sequel was announced on September 5, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>Once the news is officially confirmed this article will be updated with the relevant information.</p>\r\n<p>As previously mentioned, the final third part of The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride OAD release date is on September 9, 2022, when manga Volume 18 releases.</p>\r\n<p>The production schedule of Studio KAFKA is publicly wide open although it&#8217;s likely they&#8217;re working on securing new projects, or they&#8217;re already scheduled.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, since the official announcement confirmed the anime TV sequel in late 2022, The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride Season 2 release date will be in Spring 2023.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Anime-OVA-Announcement-Koze-Yamazaki.jpg?resize=780%2C780&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The Ancient Magus' Bride Anime \" class=\"wp-image-1066747\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Anime-OVA-Announcement-Koze-Yamazaki.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Anime-OVA-Announcement-Koze-Yamazaki.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Anime-OVA-Announcement-Koze-Yamazaki.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Anime-OVA-Announcement-Koze-Yamazaki.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Anime-OVA-Announcement-Koze-Yamazaki.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Anime-OVA-Announcement-Koze-Yamazaki.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Manga creator Koze Yamazaki released this special art for the second The Ancient Magus&#8217; Guide OVA series announcement. Pic credit: Koze Yamazaki</figcaption></figure>\r\n<h2 id=\"the-ancient-magus-bride-manga-compared-to-the-anime\">The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride manga compared to the anime</h2>\r\n<p>The story for the anime TV series is based on Mahoutsukai no Yome manga series by creator Kore Yamazaki. Serialized in Mag Garden&#8217;s Monthly Comic Garden since September 2014, the series is up to Volume 18 as of September 9, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>Historically, new volumes are released only twice a year, typically in March and September. Therefore, The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride Volume 19 release date is on March 10, 2023, while Volume 10 will presumably release in September 2023.</p>\r\n<p>In an interview with Crunchyroll, the original creator claimed she didn&#8217;t have any plans for The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride manga&#8217;s ending. However, she originally assumed the manga would end in only two volumes since she &#8220;never thought [her] manga would have any appeal to the general public&#8221;.</p>\r\n<p>The author &#8220;wanted to write a story about personal growth, which both children and grown-ups can enjoy,&#8221; and the story is about the personal journey of both Chise and Elias.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m thinking of the plot development consciously or if it&#8217;s just flowing out of my head. I think of the direction for myself, and the characters talk to me as I&#8217;m writing the story,&#8221; Yamazaki said.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the main manga, Yamazaki released two books in 2017 called The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride: The Golden Yarn and The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride: The Silver Yarn. The books contained short stories from the original creator along with other book authors like Fate/Apocrypha writer Yuichiro Higashide and Sorcerous Stabber Orphen writer Yoshinobu Akita.</p>\r\n<p>The official English translation of the manga and books is being published by Seven Seas Entertainment in North America. As of October, the English The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride manga was up to Volume 14 by April 27, 2021. The English translation of The Golden Yarn and The Silver Yarn were published in December 2018 and March 2019, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>While Yamazaki is famous for creating the Mahoutsukai no Yome manga, she has also published two other manga in the past: Futari no Renai Shoka and the supernatural drama Frau Faust. The first manga finished in 2013 and told the story of a young bookstore worker who falls in love with a customer. The second manga ended in 2017 and told the tale of a different version of the legend of Faust, the eccentric scholar who made a deal with the devil.</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, 2021, it was announced that Yamazaki was starting a new series called the Ghost and Witch manga (tentative title) that was initially released on September 10, 2021.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ghost-and-Witch-Manga-Announcement-2021-Kore-Yamazaki.jpg?resize=780%2C439&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kore Yamazaki New Manga\" class=\"wp-image-1066498\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ghost-and-Witch-Manga-Announcement-2021-Kore-Yamazaki.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ghost-and-Witch-Manga-Announcement-2021-Kore-Yamazaki.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ghost-and-Witch-Manga-Announcement-2021-Kore-Yamazaki.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ghost-and-Witch-Manga-Announcement-2021-Kore-Yamazaki.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The announcement for the Ghost and Witch manga stated, &#8220;You are nothing more than an object.

Overall, WIT Studio maintained the heart of the story and the art animation style closely followed the manga panels for many scenes.</p>\r\n<p>The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride: Those Awaiting a Star acted as a prequel of sorts. The book-loving Yamazaki wrote the story as a love letter to reading books.</p>\r\n<p>The first OVA series also provided insight into Chise&#8217;s experiences as a &#8220;sleigh beggy&#8221; child and the terror it brought her. The story takes place in a flashback that occurs well after Chise came to live with Elias, but it&#8217;s best to watch it between episodes 12 and 13 since Episode 13 made references to the events of the OVA series.</p>\r\n<p>While the first half of the first season kept true to the original story by adapting only Volume 4: Chapter 18, the second cour dramatically picked up the pacing and skimmed all the way to Volume 9.</p>\r\n<p>To pull off this fast pacing, the anime greatly condensed the manga&#8217;s dialogue down to voiceovers for certain scenes. Some anime scenes briefly summarized what was happening by silencing the characters and awkwardly showing their lips moving to the tune of background music.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, when the first season&#8217;s finale in Episode 24 first aired the anime was actually ahead of the manga! Normally, anime fans hate an &#8220;anime original ending&#8221;, but in this case, Yamazaki wrote the ending for the anime&#8217;s first season herself so it would (mostly) match up with her plans for the manga.</p>\r\n<p>One addition was the song sung by Chise during the confrontation between her and Cartaphilus. The biggest change was an extra scene where Chise chastised Elias for what he did to Stella after waking up, never mind chewing out Ruth and the others.</p>\r\n<p>The story for The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride OVA: The Boy from the West and the Knight of the Blue Storm apparently takes place in a time gap in the manga series that occurs right before Cartaphilus begins sleeping. That means the short story is set in the timeline in-between scenes in manga Chapter 45, which is coincidentally the ending of the anime’s first season.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"996\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Manga-Chapter-45-Elias-Chise-Wedding-Dress.jpg?resize=780%2C996&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mahoutsukai no Yome Manga 45\" class=\"wp-image-1066719\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Manga-Chapter-45-Elias-Chise-Wedding-Dress.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Manga-Chapter-45-Elias-Chise-Wedding-Dress.jpg?resize=235%2C300&amp;ssl=1 235w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Manga-Chapter-45-Elias-Chise-Wedding-Dress.jpg?resize=802%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 802w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Manga-Chapter-45-Elias-Chise-Wedding-Dress.jpg?resize=768%2C981&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">During the final scene, Chise was also wearing a black gothic-style wedding dress in the manga, whereas in the anime it was all white. The manga also made it more clear that Chise had not intended the rings to be viewed as engagement rings. While Chise didn&#8217;t correct Elias&#8217; misunderstanding, she did think, &#8220;&#8230;Now it looks like that&#8217;s what I was actually going for.&#8221; Pic credit: Koze Yamazaki</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>All in all, the finale, The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride Episode 24, adapted everything up until the last 5 pages of Chapter 45.</p>\r\n<p>It was the best stopping point since it provided plot resolution to the major conflict between Elias and Chise while showing them going home together after vowing to work any future conflicts out with open communication. The final 5 pages of the manga then jumped straight into introducing the next major story arc focused on Chise attending College.</p>\r\n<p>The good news is that the manga was up to Chapter 78 when the second OVA series was announced in March 2021. That means by March 2022 there should be 80 chapters, which is more than enough for making The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride Season 2 anime TV series.</p>\r\n<p>Better yet, English-only manga readers can jump straight to Volume 10 if they wish to read ahead of the anime.</p>\r\n<p>The only negative is that if the second season is two cours again then it&#8217;s likely anime fans will be waiting another four years for The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride Season 3 anime since the anime will catch up again.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"486\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Season-2-Anime-Chise-Elias-Ainsworth-London.jpg?resize=780%2C486&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The Ancient Magus' Bride Anime\" class=\"wp-image-1066753\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Season-2-Anime-Chise-Elias-Ainsworth-London.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Season-2-Anime-Chise-Elias-Ainsworth-London.jpg?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Season-2-Anime-Chise-Elias-Ainsworth-London.jpg?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Ancient-Magus-Bride-Season-2-Anime-Chise-Elias-Ainsworth-London.jpg?resize=768%2C479&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Elias and Chise will both be attending a secret magical college in London in The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride Season 2 anime.

Deep beneath the British Library, Chise and Elias are introduced to headmistress Liza Quillain and the curtain rises on a new story set on a new stage. There, human children learn, think, and grow…but what of those who are inhuman?</p>\r\n<p>Anime audiences will be introduced to a whole plethora of new characters and Chise will need to learn how to handle student life. Elias also attends as a magecraft professor to give lectures and we learn more about how magic and alchemy functions in this world. The story will also delve down into Elias&#8217; past.</p>\r\n<p>Anime audiences might also be surprised to learn that a very grumpy one-eyed Cartaphilus will occasionally rouse from his slumber to keep tabs on Chise. After all, he&#8217;s still waiting on a reply to his question&#8230; It&#8217;s also learned that the curse in Chise&#8217;s eye cannot be removed even if she removes Joseph&#8217;s eye.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s also made very clear that sleigh beggys such as Chise are actually more commonly born than natural magi. Most sleigh beggys are physically weak and end up being harvested as magical batteries for wizardry. As a sleigh beggy with a dragon&#8217;s cruse, and one of immortality, Chise is the perfect research specimen for the college, which might be able to figure out a way to remove her curse and also to improve the fate of all sleigh beggys.</p>\r\n<p>As Chise and Elias settle into their new roles at the College, old and new allies alike have lessons to teach them both inside and outside the school’s walls. The Church, the Seven Shields, and a motley array of students… Each has mysteries to uncover.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, anime fans will have to wait until The Ancient Magus&#8217; Bride Season 2 release date to watch what happens next.

Since then, 28 episodes have been released as two parts. After the way part two ended, it will be interesting to see what this next part has in store.

However, Attack of Titan has proven before that sometimes the word &#8220;final&#8221; isn&#8217;t actually final. </p>\r\n<p>So far, the final season, which is also technically the fourth season of the series, has been broken into two parts. Both parts aired separately, using the cour release style seen in other animes. Fans were expecting the series to end with Part 2 but were surprised when instead, a third part was announced. </p>\r\n<p>After that surprise, fans wondered if it could happen again, with a fourth part or even a movie. However, it has been confirmed multiple times on numerous sites now that Attack On Titan: The Final Season Part 3 will officially conclude the anime series. </p>\r\n<h2>What will Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 3 be about?</h2>\r\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t finished Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 yet, or you&#8217;re just curious about the series in general, you may be wondering what Part 3 will be about. </p>\r\n<p>The end of Part 2 saw Eren and his fleet of colossal titans finally reach Marley&#8217;s shores. Conflict will reach an all-time high as Eren&#8217;s former friends, and allies now become the ones trying to stop him. </p>\r\n<p>With only about 9 chapters left to animate, there feels like so much still needs to be covered. Viewers have yet to see Falco&#8217;s Jaw Titan in action but expect him to play a role. Fans of the manga will be excited to see important scenes between characters like Eren and Mikasa, Eren and Armin, and The Jaeger brothers finally animated. Whether or not Eren can be redeemed for actions still remains to be seen, but whatever the outcome, it&#8217;s sure to be quite the conclusion to such a popular series. </p>","url":"https://www.animegeek.com/attack-on-titan-the-final-season-part-3-releases-new-key-visual/","thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Attack-on-Titan-The-Final-Part-3-key-visual-header.jpg?w=1200&ssl=1","Publisher":"Anime Geek"}

But what will become of the man? Will Suzume’s kiss break his curse and return him to being human? If you’re lucky enough to live in Japan you can head on over to a theater near you and find out!</p>\r\n<h2>What is the plot of Suzume’s Door-Locking?</h2>\r\n<p>The story centers on a young 17-year-old girl named Suzume, who lives in a quiet town in the Kyushu region of southwestern Japan. Her boring, everyday life gets turned upside down when she encounters a mysterious, handsome man looking for a “door”.</p>\r\n<p>The two set out on an adventure together and find an old door at an abandoned house in the mountains – the house is in ruins and only the door is remaining standing upright. A supernatural force causes Suzume to reach her hand out towards the door in a daze, and open it – that’s when she’s pulled in.</p>\r\n<p>“Doors of Disaster” begin to appear across Japan and instigate a series of unfortunate calamities. It’s up to Suzume to close these doors and tie up loose ends in order to prevent future disasters.</p>\r\n<h2>What do the doors within the movie symbolize?</h2>\r\n<p>Shinkai explained that there are three main points in the film. The first is that at heart the film is a story about a <em>journey </em>– it’s about getting out into the world and meeting new people.</p>\r\n<p>The second point is that the story is about <em>closing</em> doors in order to protect people rather than opening them. This point may symbolize how when you try new things (open doors) the people around you tend to get hurt.</p>\r\n<p>The third point is that the film itself is a reason to go out into the world (when you go to the theater to see it). Closing doors symbolize tying loose ends or the end of something.</p>\r\n<p>Even though Suzume wants to close all the doors in order not to hurt anyone, life has a way of forcing itself to progress forward because as she does so she’s forced to go out into the world all around Japan and meet new people.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Suzume-no-Tojimari-new-poster.jpg?fit=1200%2C1700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Suzume no Tojimari new poster\" class=\"wp-image-1284158\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Suzume-no-Tojimari-new-poster.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Suzume-no-Tojimari-new-poster.jpg?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Suzume-no-Tojimari-new-poster.jpg?resize=723%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 723w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Suzume-no-Tojimari-new-poster.jpg?resize=768%2C1088&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Suzume-no-Tojimari-new-poster.jpg?resize=1084%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1084w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Suzume no Tojimari new poster.

On June 22, 2022, anime news leaker Sugoi LITE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SugoiLITE/status/1539569077236408321\">claimed</a>, &#8220;Date A Live TV Anime Season 5 in production.&#8221;</p><div class=\"anime-34881e649a69bc2ab18ecf17566af72e anime-inarticle-repeat\" id=\"anime-34881e649a69bc2ab18ecf17566af72e\"></div>\r\n<p>Sugoi LITE has a solid history of leaking accurate anime news. Sometimes the leaks are mere hours or days before the official announcement is made, so it wasn&#8217;t surprising when the actual Date A Live Season 5 announcement took place when the fourth season&#8217;s finale was released on June 24, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>The studio and main staffing making the Date A Live Season 5 anime hasn&#8217;t been announced yet.</p>\r\n<p>The anime TV series has been produced by a large variety of Japanese animation studios, including AIC PLUS+ (Season 1) and Production IMS (Season 2 and the 2015 Date A Live Movie: Mayuri Judgment). Production IMS eventually declared bankruptcy so once again the anime series was hot potato-tossed to J.C. Staff (Season 3). Thus, it would not be unusual if Date A Live Season 5 has yet another studio change.</p>\r\n<p>The same main staff at Studio GEEK TOYS animated both the fourth season and the <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/date-a-bullet-release-date-2-part-date-a-live-movie-fall-2020-theater-premiere/\">two-part Date A Bullet movie</a> series, which also featured Kurumi as the main character. Previously, Studio GEEK TOYS had previously worked on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/plunderer-season-2-release-date/\">2020 Plunderer anime</a>, the 2018 RErideD, and the 2019 Hensuki: Are You Willing to Fall in Love With a Pervert, as Long as She’s a Cutie?</p>\r\n<p>For the fourth season, director Jun Nakagawa (Date A Bullet, High School Fleet Movie) helmed the project, replacing director Keitaro Motonaga. Writer Fumihiko Shimo (<a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/bottom-tier-character-tomozaki-season-2-release-date-jaku-chara-tomozaki-kun-season-2/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20last%20update,announced%20on%20January%2014%2C%202022.\">Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki</a>) handled the series composition, replacing writer Hideki Shirane.</p>\r\n<p>Artist Naoto&nbsp;Nakamura (Date A Bullet, High School Fleet) was the character designer, replacing character designer (formerly key animator) Koji Watanabe.

Due to unexplained delays, the fourth season was pushed back to April 8, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>But the delays may have been bigger than publicly admitted since anime news leakers once claimed that the fourth season was coming out in Spring 2021. Considering the timing of the delays the most likely culprit is the COVID pandemic, which impacted Japan with multiple waves.</p>\r\n<p>The fourth season&#8217;s finale, Date A Live Season 4 Episode 12, was released on June 24, 2022.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Updated June 24, 2022: Dave A Live V confirmed. Added visual and actor comments.</li>\r\n<li>Updated June 22, 2022: Added Date A Live Season 5 leak.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>This article provides everything that is known about Date A Live Season 5 (Date A Live 5) and all related news. As such, this article will be updated over time with news, rumors, and analysis. Meanwhile, let’s delve down into what is known for certain.</em></p>\r\n<h2>Date A Live 5 release date predictions: DAL 5 likely in late 2023?</h2>\r\n<p>As of the last update, Studio GEEK TOYS, Nippon Columbia, publisher Kadokawa, or any company related to the production of the anime has not officially confirmed the Date A Live Season 5 release date. However, the production of the Date A Live 5 sequel was officially&nbsp;announced on June 24, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>Once the news is officially confirmed this article will be updated with the relevant information.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, it’s possible to speculate about when, or if, the Date A Live 5 release date will occur in the future.</p>\r\n<p>Arguably, the series has come a long way since the battle harem anime began with smaller studios on a smaller budget only to move up in the world as the series grew in popularity. Besides animation quality improvements there have been drastic art style changes as the anime has progressed.</p>\r\n<p>It also helps that the story quality of the source material progressed over time. The fourth season enjoyed a better tale focus on new spirits Nia Honjou and Mukuro Hoshimiya and thus the studio was able to focus on adapting a relatively small number of books.</p>\r\n<p>As such, the Date A Live 4 reviews have significantly better scores than all of the previous seasons. That relative popularity probably translates to a better boost for Blu-Ray/DVD and light novel sales, so that&#8217;s why we predicted that it was very likely the anime production committee would have Date A Live Season 5 renewed. The only question is when it&#8217;ll be released.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">TOP Best-Selling Light Novel Series April 2022 · Japan<br><br>Roshidere at the very top!<br><br>Also I don&#39;t know why Oricon has separated that Kirby novel from the other group, maybe to take more spots? <a href=\"https://t.co/oguU3hwtVd\">pic.twitter.com/oguU3hwtVd</a></p>&mdash; 寿 三井 (@Josu_ke) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Josu_ke/status/1523716079637303296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 9, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n</div></figure>\r\n<p>What was the reason for the long five-year wait between Seasons 3 and 4? There’s been no official explanation, although in 2014 the anime had already adapted about two-thirds of the available source material.</p>\r\n<p>Now, the situation is completely different since the Date A Live book series is finished and the anime production committee can plan out the remainder of the anime adaptation at their leisure. The 10th Anniversary projects were not simply toeing the waters to see if the series should be renewed all the way to the ending since the producer apparently already has a multi-year plan.</p>\r\n<p>Since the production was immediately announced in June 2022, then the earliest we might expect the Dave A Live V release date to be in late 2023 or early 2024.</p>\r\n<p>That&#8217;s assuming pre-production began way before the fourth season aired. Otherwise, we might expect a multi-year wait if pre-production didn&#8217;t begin until 2022. </p>\r\n<h2>Date A Live Season 5 English dub release date predictions</h2>\r\n<p>Crunchyroll&#8217;s Date A Live Season 4 English dub release date was on April 22, 2022.

Pic credit: Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>\r\n<h2>Date A Light light novel series/manga compared to the anime&#8217;s fourth season</h2>\r\n<p>The story for Date A Live Season 5 will be based on the light novel book series by author Koushi Tachibana and illustrator Tsunako. Celebrating the end of the light novels, the series finished with Volume 22 on March 19, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Started in 2012, the Date A Live manga adaptation suffered an early death. Manga artist Kakashi Oniyazu only released six chapters before the manga series was canceled due to the mangaka suffering from health problems.</p>\r\n<p>There’s been no sign of another manga artist picking up the story from where it left off. Needless to say, that means the manga adaptation is far behind the main story of the anime since it only covered part of the first date with Tohka. However, there are other manga spin-offs like Date A Origami and Date A Party.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest problem for anime fans wanting to read ahead in the story is that an official English translation of the Date A Live light novel series has never been licensed by any publisher.</p>\r\n<p>English-only readers can’t even turn to any fan-made translation projects since book publisher Kadokawa served them DMCA takedown notices years ago.</p>\r\n<p>The last fan project stopped in 2015 with only part of Volume 13 translated. The download page for the main project is now a dead link, but other sites still host all 13 books. Even Novel Updates doesn&#8217;t have any non-dead links.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"726\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Date-A-Live-Volume-17-Light-Novel-Cover-Art-Nibelcole.jpg?resize=726%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Date A Live 17\" class=\"wp-image-1265830\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Date-A-Live-Volume-17-Light-Novel-Cover-Art-Nibelcole.jpg?resize=726%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 726w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Date-A-Live-Volume-17-Light-Novel-Cover-Art-Nibelcole.jpg?resize=213%2C300&amp;ssl=1 213w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Date-A-Live-Volume-17-Light-Novel-Cover-Art-Nibelcole.jpg?resize=768%2C1083&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Date-A-Live-Volume-17-Light-Novel-Cover-Art-Nibelcole.jpg?resize=1089%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1089w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Date-A-Live-Volume-17-Light-Novel-Cover-Art-Nibelcole.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">It&#8217;s predicted that Date A Live Season 5 will pick up the story again in light novel Volume 17. Pic credit: Tsunako</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>The first season adapted the first four novels, the second season adapted Volumes 5 through 7, and then J.C. Staff hit the gas by adapting five books (Volumes 8 through 12) with the third season. The reason that’s a problem is due to the third season essentially rushing through Volume 12: Itsuka Disaster.</p>\r\n<p>The first 11 episodes adapted the story arcs for Natsumi and Origami which were two books apiece. But then for Episode 12, J.C. Staff made the baffling decision to summarize the entire “sealed spiritual power within Shido running rampant” disaster story arc in one episode, which made it feel more like an extra OVA episode rather than a proper ending to a full season.</p>\r\n<p>Even characters like Mana Takamiya were struck from the anime’s story entirely even though she appeared in Volumes 8 and 12. More importantly, the introduction of Artemisia Bell Ashcroft was skipped and she appears in Volumes 12 through 17, replacing Mana as DEM’s Adeptus 2 in the new timeline.</p>\r\n<p>Artemisia plays an important role in relation to another major character whose introduction in Volume 12 was skipped by the anime. But that new character was directly relevant to the story of Date A Live Season 4.</p>\r\n<p>Light novel fans are used to anime versions condensing the story, but this was the first time the Date A Live anime reduced an entire book down to one episode. It almost feels as if the third season was arbitrarily forced into ending with a 12-episode format.</p>\r\n<p>Thankfully, Date A Live Season 4 returned the adaptation pacing to a more reasonable level by only adapting four books. That decision meant that Spirits Nia Honjou and Mukuro Hoshimiya were given the attention they needed in order to properly tell these two story arcs before launching into the Kurumi&nbsp;arc.</p>\r\n<p>Date A Live Season 4 Episode 1 even went back to the disaster story arc from Volume 12 by adapting several missing scenes that were skipped by the Season 3 finale.</p>\r\n<p>All in all, it&#8217;s predicted that the ending of the fourth season&#8217;s finale, Date A Live Season 4 Episode 12, will correspond to light novel Date A Live Volume 16: Kurumi Refrain.</p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s the best stopping point since finishing with Volume 16 means ending with a big cliffhanger that sets up the next anime season. Additionally, Volumes 16 through 19 are interconnected with Mio&#8217;s arc and conclude with a huge climax. Then the light novel finale arc consists of three final volumes.</p>\r\n<p>That means Date A Live Season 5 should be adapting three books since it&#8217;d be crazy to try and jam the final six books into 12 or 13 episodes.</p>\r\n<p>Does that mean Date A Live Season 6 will adapt the final ending in Volumes 20 through 22? Without getting into spoilers, Volume 20 set up the conditions for ending the entire story. The final three volumes might be best adapted as a final two-part Date A Live movie.</p>\r\n<p>Light novel readers who wish to read ahead of the anime can jump straight to Date A Live Volume 17: Kurumi Ragnarok.</p>\r\n<h2>Date A Live V anime TV spoilers (plot summary/synopsis)</h2>\r\n<p>Date A Live Season 5 will launch an all-out war between &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; and DEM. This war begins with the revelation that Shido is fated to die.</p>\r\n<p>The truth is that Kurumi, despite being called the Worst Spirit, had selflessly put herself into a time loop in order to prevent Shido&#8217;s death. To prevent this worst future, Kurumi had shouldered the fate of the entire world and now this truth has been revealed by Shido to the other Spirits.</p>\r\n<p>Westcott mobilizes all of DEM&#8217;s forces to kill Shido and break Kurumi&#8217;s resolve. In response, &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; rallies all of the Spirits to defend Shido at all costs.</p>\r\n<p>Past memories will be unlocked and further truths will be revealed. It&#8217;s already known that most of the Spirits have a human origin, but what of the origin of the First Spirit? And will Shido be able to win over Kurumi&#8217;s heart and avert disaster by changing the future?</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, anime fans will have to wait until the Date A Live Season 5 release date to watch what happens next.

They&#8217;re named after famous racehorses worldwide, and you don&#8217;t need to know the rules to enjoy this franchise.</p>\r\n<p>Season 1 focused on Special Week and her dream of being the best Horse Girl in Japan. While Season 2 focused on Tokai Teio and gave us more time with other Horse Girls.</p><div class=\"anime-0ecfa9a1eb1a213cd8b0f5337e424616 anime-inarticle-repeat\" id=\"anime-0ecfa9a1eb1a213cd8b0f5337e424616\"></div>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"ja\" dir=\"ltr\">【TVアニメ情報！】<br>TVアニメ「ウマ娘 プリティーダービー」第3期の制作が決定！<br>情報解禁PVを公開しました！<br><br>新しい物語にご期待ください！<a href=\"https://t.co/WWuv4A097I\">https://t.co/WWuv4A097I</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9E%E5%A8%98?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ウマ娘</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9E%E5%A8%984th?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ウマ娘4th</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9E%E5%A8%98?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#アニメウマ娘</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/tQMYwj3BUU\">pic.twitter.com/tQMYwj3BUU</a></p>&mdash; ウマ娘プロジェクト公式アカウント (@uma_musu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/uma_musu/status/1589220046865588227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 6, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n</div></figure>\r\n<p>So it&#8217;s a safe bet that Uma Musume: Pretty Derby Season 3 will also focus on a different Horse Girl. However, <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/uma-musume-x-familymart-collab-announced-as-part-of-anniversary-campaign/\">Uma Musume Pretty Derby</a> Road to the Top appears to be working similarly.</p>\r\n<p>The above visual shows T. M. Opera O, Admire Vega, and Narita Top Road. And it seems to focus on the heavier themes of the franchise.</p>\r\n<p>All of the Horse Girls want to win and work hard to achieve their goals. But just like in other sports, there&#8217;s only one winner.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"ja\" dir=\"ltr\">【新シリーズ配信アニメ続報！】<br>新作アニメーション「ウマ娘 プリティーダービー Road to the Top」のティザーPVと、ナリタトップロードら3人のドラマチックなキービジュアルを公開！<br><br>2023年春ごろ配信予定です！<a href=\"https://t.co/K8c2qg4It0\">https://t.co/K8c2qg4It0</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9E%E5%A8%98?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ウマ娘</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9E%E5%A8%984th?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ウマ娘4th</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9E%E5%A8%98%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%88%E3%82%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B6%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ウマ娘ロードトゥーザトップ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/SM4lq8ZQDD\">pic.twitter.com/SM4lq8ZQDD</a></p>&mdash; ウマ娘プロジェクト公式アカウント (@uma_musu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/uma_musu/status/1589220442996633600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 6, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n</div></figure>\r\n<h2>A friendly competition?</h2>\r\n<p>For a series that focuses on horseracing, it has some interesting twists. First, the winner and the second and third runner-ups celebrate their victories with a concert!</p>\r\n<p>So they have to focus on speed, stamina, and strength, and they have to know how to dance and sing. Their shoes look normal on top but have a metal bottom, just like a horseshoe.</p>\r\n<p>And all the girls look distinct, despite many not getting much screen time. With so many characters, it&#8217;s hard to remember their names unless we see them every episode.</p>\r\n<p>But if you like Hetalia and Kan Colle, you&#8217;ll like Uma Musume Pretty Derby. And if you&#8217;re a gamer, Cygames created the mobile app, the anime, and the manga they are based upon!</p>\r\n<p>There are also typical school shenanigans and plenty of ways to enjoy the franchise. Unfortunately, although it&#8217;s a cute series, Uma Musume Pretty Derby doesn&#8217;t inspire me to go horseback riding.</p>\r\n<p>The girls look like they are doing track and field and wearing cosplay. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with it, but if the description and various drops in the anime say Horse Girl.</p>\r\n<p>I would&#8217;ve assumed this is another idol anime with sports added.</p>","url":"https://www.animegeek.com/uma-musume-pretty-derby-season-3-and-road-to-the-top-web-anime-announced/","thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Uma-Musume-Season-3-release-date-Uma-Musume-Pretty-Derby-Season-3-Anime.jpg?w=1200&ssl=1","Publisher":"Anime Geek"}

Marin voice actress Hina Suguta and Gojou voice actor Shouya Ishige were very careful to only refer to the anime continuation as a &#8220;sequel&#8221; rather than as the 2nd season during their presentation.</p>\r\n<p>However, the Sono Bisque Doll sequel is unlikely to be a movie since the next manga story arcs to be adapted by the anime really aren&#8217;t the best fit for a film. If a My Dress-Up Darling movie introduced an anime original story the film also wouldn&#8217;t be considered a &#8220;sequel&#8221; per se.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, Sono Bisque Doll anime producer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kafunsyokougun/status/1571089499438059524\">Shouta Umehara</a> blatantly referred to the sequel as My Dress-Up Darling Season 2. On Twitter, he tweeted about how there originally weren&#8217;t any plans to make a second season, but the sequel is thanks to the support of anime fans.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the power of the support of everyone who watched the anime and bought various things from us!&#8221; Umehara wrote. &#8220;I&#8217;m in a bad situation at work because there&#8217;s so much unplanned, but as long as there are people who are happy to see it, I&#8217;ll do my best!</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"723\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/My-Dress-Up-Darlings-latest-event-poster.jpg?resize=723%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"My Dress-Up Darling's latest event poster\" class=\"wp-image-1278688\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/My-Dress-Up-Darlings-latest-event-poster.jpg?resize=723%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 723w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/My-Dress-Up-Darlings-latest-event-poster.jpg?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/My-Dress-Up-Darlings-latest-event-poster.jpg?resize=768%2C1088&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/My-Dress-Up-Darlings-latest-event-poster.jpg?resize=1084%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1084w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/My-Dress-Up-Darlings-latest-event-poster.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The poster for My Dress-Up Darling Eh～?! It&#8217;s OMG Insane to See You All! Pic credit: Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>Besides the indirect confirmation by the producer, what is known for certain is that the My Dress-Up Darling Season 2 announcement was always highly likely now that the first season&#8217;s Blu-Ray volumes sales were a knockout success. </p>\r\n<p>My Dress-Up Darling 2 was also apparently announced in September 2022 amidst conflicting rumors that production had already secretly started. Even <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/girlfriend-girlfriend-season-2-release-date-kanojo-mo-kanojo-season-2/\">Girlfriend, Girlfriend Season 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/rent-a-girlfriend-season-3-release-date-kanojo-okarishimasu-season-3/\">Rent-A-Girlfriend Season 3</a> were announced in September 2022, so why not Sono Bisque Doll Season 2?</p>\r\n<p>Earlier in 2022, anime news leakers were disputing whether My Dress-Up Darling S2 was secretly in production. For example, anime news site <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AniNewsAndFacts/status/1554520214024646657\">Anime News &amp; Facts</a> claimed that &#8220;My Dress-Up Darling Season 2 [is] in Production&#8221; on August 2, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>In an apparent response to that tweet, trustworthy anime news leaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SugoiLITE/status/1554529527585718273\">Sugoi LITE</a> flat-out denied the rumor.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;Since someone asked, there&#8217;s currently NO sequel project to [the] TV Anime &#8216;My Dress-Up Darling&#8217; in production,&#8217; Sugoi LITE claimed. &#8220;Be careful of such ridiculous rumors.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, when a Twitter follower pointed out that &#8220;there is realistically a chance of 2nd season being announced in the Aniplex online event since it [the manga] has enough source material to adapt a 2nd season&#8221; Sugoi LITE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SugoiLITE/status/1554538651899404288\">replied</a>, &#8220;Yeah I hope so. Aniplex Online Fest is the biggest opportunity to announce a sequel to one of their most successful anime projects of 2021.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that both sides do not have any official sources to substantiate their claims. As such, both claims should be treated as a rumor.

As such, this article will be updated over time with news, rumors, and analysis. Meanwhile, let’s delve down into what is known for certain.</em></p>\r\n<h2>Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2 release date predictions: Is 2024 likely? </h2>\r\n<p>As of the last update, Aniplex, Square Enix, Studio CloverWorks, or any company related to the production of the anime has not officially confirmed the My-Dress Up Darling Season 2 release date. However, the production of a My Dress-Up Darling sequel was&nbsp;announced on September 17, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>Once the news is officially confirmed this article will be updated with the relevant information.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, it’s possible to speculate about when, or if, the Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2 release date will occur in the future.</p>\r\n<p>Just going by the My Dress-Up Darling reviews it seemed likely that a TV sequel would be greenlit for production. The first season posted scores way above average for a RomCom slice-of-life anime. In fact, some weekly polls during Winter 2022 had certain My Dress-Up Darling episodes beating popular anime such as <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/attack-on-titan-season-4-part-3-release-date-shingeki-no-kyojin-season-4-part-3-final/\">Attack On Titan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/demon-slayer-season-3-release-date-kimetsu-no-yaiba-season-3-swordsmith-village-arc/\">Demon Slayer</a>!</p>\r\n<p>As previously noted, the My Dress-Up Darling Volume 1 Blu-Ray and DVD did very well in its first week of sales in Japan. The combined total was 10,130 copies (8,931 BD and 1,199 DVD).</p>\r\n<p>To put that number in perspective, we can compare the Volume 1 Blu-Ray sales to other popular anime that were renewed for a sequel.</p>\r\n<p>Attack On Titan Season 4: Part 1 sold 3,108 copies (<a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/attack-on-titan-season-4-part-3-release-date-shingeki-no-kyojin-season-4-part-3-final/\">Attack On Titan Season 4 Part 3</a> or an Attack On Titan: The Rumbling movie are very likely). It should be noted that the first season of AoT sold an astounding 52,078 copies but was never able to duplicate the initial success.</p>\r\n<p>My Next Life as a Villainess sold 5,111 (<a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/my-next-life-as-a-villainess-season-2-release-date-hamefura-season-2-bakarina-otome-game-no-hametsu-flag-shika-nai-akuyaku-reijou-ni-tensei-shiteshimatta/\">My Next Life as a Villainess Season 2</a>&nbsp;came out in 2021 and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/my-next-life-as-a-villainess-movie-release-date-hamefura-movie-trailer/?swcfpc=1\">My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! movie</a>&nbsp;was announced).</p>\r\n<p>Haikyuu!!

Season 4 Part 2</a>&nbsp;came out in Fall 2020 and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/haikyuu-season-5-release-date-haikyu-s5/\">Haikyuu!! Season 5</a>&nbsp;should continue the story).</p>\r\n<p>Magia Record sold 7,974 copies (<a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/magia-record-season-3-release-date-confirmed-2021-asaki-yume-no-akatsuki-dawn-of-shallow-dreams-final-season-magia-record-puella-magi-madoka-magica-side-story/\">Magia Record Season 3</a>&nbsp;finished the story in 2022).</p>\r\n<p>Of course, streaming revenue, not BD sales in Japan, is the major factor influencing the decisions of the anime production committee. In that regard, My Dress-Up Darling Season 1 was definitely a success worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>The boost in manga sales was another reason for the anime production committee to have My Dress-Up Darling renewed. After the anime&#8217;s first season premiered on January 8, 2022, the number of copies in circulation increased by one million by February 2, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>Twenty days later, that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MangaMoguraRE/status/1496111298265890820\">number increased</a> by another half a million. Another month later, on March 22, 2022, Aniplex announced that the total was up to 5.5 million copies in circulation. On April 15, 2022, Young Gangan magazine announced 6 million copies, which means the anime boosted the manga&#8217;s circulation by about 2.5 million copies.</p>\r\n<p>On September 22, 2022, shortly after My Dress-Up Darling Season 2 was confirmed to be in production, it was also announced that the manga had reached <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MangaMoguraRE/status/1572892404168130560\">7.5 million copies</a> in circulation for manga volumes 1 through 10.</p>\r\n<p>While that&#8217;s not a <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/tokyo-revengers-season-2-release-date/\">Tokyo Revengers</a> level boost, it was enough to make it on the Oricon Top 15 chart for the first two months of 2022. In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WSJ_manga/status/1499681049504329729\">February 2022</a>, the manga sold 406,226 copies and was number 7 in Oricon&#8217;s Top 20 by Series.</p>\r\n<p>The My Dress-Up Darling even outsold popular manga like the <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/attack-on-titan-requiem-manga-shingeki-no-kyojin-alternate-ending-fans-aot-requiem-part-2-release-date/\">Attack On Titan manga</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/dr-stone-manga-ending-soon-final-story-arc-chapter-213/\">Dr. STONE manga</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/one-punch-man-season-3-release-date-opm-manga-saitama-garou-spoilers/\">One Punch Man</a> manga, the <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/komi-cant-communicate-season-2-release-date-2022-netflix-komi-san-wa-comyushou-desu-season-2/\">Komi Can&#8217;t Communicate</a> manga, the <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun-season-3-release-date-mairimashita-iruma-kun-season-3/\">Welcome to Demon-School! Iruma-kun</a> manga, the <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/golden-kamuy-season-4-release-date/\">Golden Kamuy</a> manga, the <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/rent-a-girlfriend-season-2-release-date-kanojo-okarishimasu-season-2-summer-2022-trailer/\">Rent-A-Girlfriend</a> manga, and the <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/spy-x-family-anime-release-date-2022-trailer/\">Spy x Family</a> manga during that time frame. Notably, all of those series had, or will have anime TV sequels (even Spy x Family had Spy x Family Part 2).</p>\r\n<p>The main issue is whether Aniplex already planned out the second season of the My Dress-Up Darling anime in advance. If early pre-production began before the first season finished airing then the second season could come out in late 2023, but if not then anime fans should expect a multi-year wait for the TV sequel.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, it&#8217;s predicted that the My Dress-Up Darling Season 2 release date will be in 2024 at the earliest.</p>\r\n<h2>Crunchyroll&#8217;s My-Dress Up Darling Season 2 English dub release date</h2>\r\n<p>In Winter 2022, the My Dress-Up Darling Season 1 anime was streaming on Crunchyroll, Funimation, VRV, and Netflix Japan (not Netflix USA, Hulu, or Amazon Prime Video).</p>\r\n<p>Crunchyroll and Funimation both were streaming the English dubbed version. Here is the My Dress-Up Darling dub cast:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Amanda Lee as Marin Kitagawa</li>\r\n<li>Paul Dateh as Wakana Gojo</li>\r\n<li>R Bruce Elliott as Kaoru Gojo (Grandpa)</li>\r\n<li>Dani Chambers as Nowa Sugaya</li>\r\n<li>Madeleine Morris as Rune</li>\r\n<li>Jack Britton as young Wakana</li>\r\n<li>Lila Britton as Nobara</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Funimation and Crunchyroll’s My Dress-Up Darling English dub release date was on January 29, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>Presumably, the My Dress-Up Darling Season 2 English dub will be announced in the future since the second season is greenlit for production. Since Sony bought both Crunchyroll and Funimation it&#8217;s likely that Crunchyroll will be streaming the new episodes with the English dub. <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/muv-luv-alternative-season-2-release-date-fall-2022/\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>My Dress-Up Darling manga compared to the anime</h2>\r\n<p>The story for the anime TV show is based on the My Dress-Up Darling manga series by creator Shinichi Fukada. Serialized twice a month in Square Enix&#8217;s Young Gangan magazine since January 2018, the Seinen manga series was up to Volume 10 as of September 24, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>The Japanese title Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru is literally translated into English as The Bisque Doll That Fell in Love. But when <a href=\"https://squareenixmangaandbooks.square-enix-games.com/en-us/series/my-dress-up-darling\">Square Enix Manga &amp; Books</a> announced the official English translation they titled it My Dress-Up Darling.</p>\r\n<p>The English version was up to Volume 6 as of August 2022, with Volume 7 scheduled to release on January 24, 2023, Volume 8 on March 14, 2023, and Volume 9 on June 20, 2023.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"936\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Volume-6-Manga-Cover-Art-Marin-Cosplay.jpg?resize=780%2C936&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Marin Kitagawa\" class=\"wp-image-1261551\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Volume-6-Manga-Cover-Art-Marin-Cosplay.jpg?resize=853%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 853w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Volume-6-Manga-Cover-Art-Marin-Cosplay.jpg?resize=250%2C300&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Volume-6-Manga-Cover-Art-Marin-Cosplay.jpg?resize=768%2C922&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Volume-6-Manga-Cover-Art-Marin-Cosplay.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">It&#8217;s predicted that the My Dress-Up Darling Season 2 anime TV series will pick up the story again in Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru manga Volume 6. Pic credit: Shinichi Fukuda</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>Even My Dress-Up Darling manga purists have been loving on the anime adaptation. The animation quality was great and you have to wonder if CloverWorks was making a self-referential joke by adding the line, &#8220;The animation is godlike.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>They even animated the magical girl anime in 4:3 format with a <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/top-20-anime-1990s/\">1990s anime</a> filter for the shading, never mind the Precure, Card Captor Sakura, and Ojamajo Doremi&nbsp;references.</p>\r\n<p>The anime literally followed the first chapter of the manga almost panel-by-panel except for a few minor tweaks that actually improved the story. Marin&#8217;s introduction had a much more dramatic flare since she only lightly bumped Gojo&#8217;s desk in the manga rather than flying backward through the air.</p>\r\n<p>In later episodes, Episode 8 introduced the anime original scene on the beach where the bird was stealing Marin&#8217;s burger. There were also more scenes from the Magical Girl anime.</p>\r\n<p>There was also some rearranging of some story elements in My Dress-Up Darling Episodes 4 through 6. Some elements from Chapter 11 were split up among those episodes. Juju&#8217;s introduction was also earlier in the manga since she was shown seeing Marin&#8217;s cosplay pics immediately after they were posted online, whereas the anime showed that scene as a flashback.</p>\r\n<p>The introductory episode even had cameos from later story arcs. For example, some of the guys from the school festival arc are already in the OP.</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, in My Dress-Up Darling Episode 7, Marin&#8217;s room literally became a treasure trove of spoilers for future cosplay and character cameos. Notably, the Council Host Rei-sama cosplay references were absent so that scene will be part of My Dress-Up Darling Season 2.</p>\r\n<p>There was also some censorship in the anime, including the introduction scene of Juju aka Sajuna Inui in Chapter 16. When she panicked and slipped after taking a shower, both Gojo and manga readers got to see everything&#8230; which made the joke about the Hina dolls being smooth more understandable.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Juju-Intro-Gojo-Eye-Code-Geass.jpg?resize=780%2C439&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juju Sajuna Inui My Dress Up Darling\" class=\"wp-image-1261467\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Juju-Intro-Gojo-Eye-Code-Geass.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Juju-Intro-Gojo-Eye-Code-Geass.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Juju-Intro-Gojo-Eye-Code-Geass.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Juju-Intro-Gojo-Eye-Code-Geass.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Steam-kun and light beam-kun got to take a break since CloverWorks simply shifted Juju&#8217;s towel and the camera angles to be more discreet. On the other hand, the original way that Juju&#8217;s body was reflected in Gojo&#8217;s eyes almost made the scene feel lewder. (And, it&#8217;s almost an odd <a href=\"https://www.animegeek.com/code-geass-z-of-the-recapture-release-date-2021-code-geass-season-3-r3-sequel-confirmed-studio-sunrise/\">Code Geass</a> reference.) Pic credit: Studio CloverWorks</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>In Episode 5, the anime also removed a line where Marin jokingly asks Gojo if she makes a proper s*x sl*ve. There were also two girls at the cosplay event who thought that Gojo was a girl dressed in drag.</p>\r\n<p>When Marin&#8217;s dress blew up from the winder, the tally marks on Marin&#8217;s thighs weren&#8217;t explained as a reference to the eroge game. These black lines were supposed to represent the number of times the Shizuka-tan character had been &#8220;used&#8221; by her master.</p>\r\n<p>Episode 8 skipped some fan service moments when Marin held the seaweed.</p>\r\n<p>As for adaptation pacing, Chapter 1 was double the size of a normal chapter, so that&#8217;s why the initial pacing was &#8220;slow&#8221;. From, there the anime began averaging a pacing of about three to four chapters per episode, and the story was mostly adapted in a straightforward linear fashion, but then starting with Episode 8 the pacing accelerated in order for the anime to finish with the best stopping point.</p>\r\n<p>In order to pull this off, some internal monologues were skipped and even some spoken dialogue was condensed. For example, when grandpa found out about Gojo having women&#8217;s stockings the cousin spoke at length in the manga about gender stereotypes, whereas the anime simplified that scene down by claiming it wasn&#8217;t unheard of for boys Gojo&#8217;s age to have stockings.</p>\r\n<p>Episode 9 adapted 5 chapters so it had to skim over a lot of the cosplay tips discussion. The episode also cut a good shopkeeper gag from Chapter 24.</p>\r\n<p>The earlier skimming and condensing was all worth it since Episode 11 pulled off the Love Hotel story arc perfectly with anime original extras like the bedsprings shot and the lights going out, never mind the sound effects. The steamy moments were stretched out to the point that you could cut the sexual tension with a knife. The final scene showed Gojo visiting his old pal tissue box-kun just like the final panel of Chapter 36!</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"541\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Manga-Chapter-39-Marin-x-Gojo-Confession.jpg?resize=780%2C541&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"My Dress-Up Darling Season 1 Ending\" class=\"wp-image-1261550\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Manga-Chapter-39-Marin-x-Gojo-Confession.jpg?resize=1024%2C710&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Manga-Chapter-39-Marin-x-Gojo-Confession.jpg?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Manga-Chapter-39-Marin-x-Gojo-Confession.jpg?resize=768%2C532&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Manga-Chapter-39-Marin-x-Gojo-Confession.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The ending of My Dress-Up Darling Volume 5 teased readers by stating, &#8220;They&#8217;ll continue that phone call one day&#8230;&#8221; Pic credit: Shinichi Fukuda</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>All in all, as predicted the first season&#8217;s finale, Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Episode 12, found a stopping point corresponding to the ending of Volume 5: Chapter 39.</p>\r\n<p>The first season made it obvious that it would finish the Love Hotel photoshoot story arc since the OP video only showed Marin&#8217;s cosplay outfits up until the Succubus. Finishing with the summer festival and the home date was the best stopping point since the love hotel scene moves forward the Marin x Gojo ship ever so slightly but ending on that note wouldn&#8217;t have provided proper plot resolution like the final moments of the summer vacation break. </p>\r\n<p>The only major difference from the manga is that the anime did not introduce Marin&#8217;s father, which makes sense since it would be odd to introduce a new character right at the end of a season. Instead, CloverWorks reworked certain scenes so everything connected without the presence of Papa Kitagawa, which also allowed more time for fireworks and the post-credits scene.</p>\r\n<p>The good news is that there should be enough chapters for making My Dress-Up Darling Season 2 before the end of 2022. </p>\r\n<p>The only bad news is that English-only manga readers who wished to read ahead of the anime needed to wait until Volume 6 came out in August 2022.</p>\r\n<h2>My Dress-Up Darling 2 anime spoilers (plot summary/synopsis)</h2>\r\n<p>Ever since he got roped into helping Marin, Wakana has had his world and perceptions expanded by cosplay. In fact, it&#8217;s even helped him find peace with himself!</p>\r\n<p>And that seems to be one of cosplay&#8217;s superpowers, as Wakana and Marin discover at an Ikebukuro event. There, they meet crossplayer Amane and hear their cosplay origin story, which gives Marin the push she needs to decide on her next costume!</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately for Wakana, getting the new outfit ready is going to be anything but easy&#8230;</p>\r\n<p>Gojo and Marin will also have new firsts together like the high school festival. But what makes it even more interesting is that they will be cosplaying in school!</p>\r\n<p>But anime-only fans probably want to know when the Gojo x Marin relationship is going to heat up. Thus far, even though Marin obviously &#8220;wuvs&#8221; Gojo, the manga series has been largely focused on cosplay rather than romantic developments like confessions, hand-holding, kissing, and dates. Romantic tension will definitely be an undertone to My Dress-Up Darling Season 2, but it won&#8217;t be the focus like in Horimiya since they&#8217;re both still stuck in that awkward, self-doubting phase of a manga relationship.</p>\r\n<p>Anime-only fans may also be wondering if the &#8220;first girl&#8221; from Gojo&#8217;s childhood will make an appearance in My Dress-Up Darling Season 2, but as of Winter 2022, Gojo hadn&#8217;t received any catharsis in that regard in the manga. But some manga readers suspect that a character named Akira might be this young girl based on how suspicious she&#8217;s been acting.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Akira-Manga-Sono-Bisque-Doll-wa-Koi-wo-Suru.jpg?resize=780%2C440&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"My Dress-Up Darling manga first girl\" class=\"wp-image-1261485\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Akira-Manga-Sono-Bisque-Doll-wa-Koi-wo-Suru.jpg?resize=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Akira-Manga-Sono-Bisque-Doll-wa-Koi-wo-Suru.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Akira-Manga-Sono-Bisque-Doll-wa-Koi-wo-Suru.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.animegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/My-Dress-Up-Darling-Akira-Manga-Sono-Bisque-Doll-wa-Koi-wo-Suru.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">This reaction from My Dress-Up Darling&#8217;s Akira in Chapter 68 made readers sus.
